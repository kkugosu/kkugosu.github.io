&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
there has been numerous elaboration to find out like “what is ai”, “how can we build most plausable ai” and “what is intelligence” and lots of paper successfully gave us deep inspiration about fundamental implementation of ai. eventhough there has been enourmous pregress in AI, we still can’t explain why we have curiousity and still failed to make how to make model to learn maximizing pac bayes bound.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wanna write about the most fundamental and important concepts we encounter when we first learn about AI which are namely bias and variance.
actually these two concept imply opposite things bias means assumption and variance means non-assumption which is like even though we learn something which works simillar as preliminary learned, we should not assume that will works simillary.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the matter at hand is, we have to strike a balance between two concept. for example, when you take the ramen and their color was red, you can think every red food is spicy if you are really biasd. but you have to be more specific in the real life and take that as depending on the context. however you should have bias to some extent. when you learned something from specific situation, you should be able to adapt that principle for another situation as well.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the representative theory which discuss about this is called PAC and we usually employ PAC-bayes bounds in academic paper. and also there has been attempts which aim to make model to autonomously strike a balance by themselves which is called autoML
there are many different kinds of techniques which is included in autoML framework called HPO(hyper parameter optimization), NAS(neural architecture search), meta learning and more
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
\(x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-math&quot;&gt;\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)

A
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as society becomming diverse, every individuals are getting to serve their own role rather than doing everything. as our role is getting diverse, we need to communicate each other to accomplish big project. some want to communicate more frequently and i will delve into my perspective in detail in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As society becomes more diverse, individuals are increasingly taking on specific roles instead of trying to do everything themselves. With this diversification of roles, effective communication becomes crucial for accomplishing big projects. Some individuals prefer to communicate more frequently, and I will further elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;getting -&amp;gt; increasingly
&lt;br /&gt;
some -&amp;gt; some individuals
&lt;br /&gt;
serve role -&amp;gt; taking on role
&lt;br /&gt;
their own -&amp;gt; specific
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is important to see things from another person’s point of view as it will prevent works to be concentrated on few persons resulting in improving the performance doing a project as a whole. moreover we can prevent ourselves from doing unnessarily elaborate by anticipate the workflow. for example, when we build website, if developer already know manager don’t usually use customer service, they don’t need to make that window.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Considering things from another person’s perspective is crucial as it prevents work from being biased towards a few individuals, leading to improved performance by ensuring the collaboration of all team members on a project. Additionally, anticipating the workflow allows us to avoid unnecessary elaboration. For example, when building a website, if a developer knows that the manager rarely utilizes customer service, they can omit creating that specific page.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;concentrated -&amp;gt; biased, skewed
&lt;br /&gt;
concentrate 는 좀더 추상적인
&lt;br /&gt;
bias skew는 물리적인
&lt;br /&gt;
expect -&amp;gt; anticipate
&lt;br /&gt;
expect = 결과물에 대한 예상
&lt;br /&gt;
anticipate 미래의 사건
&lt;br /&gt;
use -&amp;gt; utilize
&lt;br /&gt;
don’t make -&amp;gt; omit
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but if there is inequality of information or manager is lake of consideration, and also if they don’t compensate enough money to staff, act of sharing is becomming meaningless and that even can cause employee to give leeway to get nagging. for example, assumimg employee talk with employer on weekends and employer is lake of considerate, they probably ask employee to work more without money.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But if there is a lack of information equality or the manager lacks consideration, and if they don’t provide sufficient compensation to the staff, the act of sharing becomes meaningless. This can even lead the employer to justify nagging. For example, if an employee talks to their employer on weekends and the employer lacks consideration, they may ask the employee to work more without providing additional compensation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
in conclution, as long as we fail to see things from other people’s side, like modern society, it is better to work just for our given portion.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In conclusion, if we continue to overlook other people’s perspectives, similar to modern society, it is advisable to focus on fulfilling our own assigned roles. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;as long as -&amp;gt; if we continue to
&lt;br /&gt;
it is better to -&amp;gt; it is advisable to

capitalism is great concept in global society and it is great motivation of making people to work hard. but nowadays with advancement, some company are starting to provide stuff more easily and which leads them to earn every money instead of local company. i will delve my perspective in the following paragraph.

Capitalism is a great concept in global society and serves as a significant motivation for people to work hard. However, with advancements in technology, certain companies have begun to provide goods and services more easily, resulting in their dominance over local businesses and the accumulation of vast wealth. I will further explore my perspective on this matter in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;USA boston media investigation of changing number of local business and average income for a last 50years illuminates these two indicators are diminishing at the same time which means these have positive relation each other. the reason behind this phenomenon is arised from flow of money. the man who benefit most from this is head office which means money is eventually goes to the head office of company not local.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The investigation conducted by the media in Boston, USA, on the changing number of local businesses and average income over the past 50 years reveals a simultaneous decline in both indicators, indicating a positive correlation between them. The underlying reason behind this phenomenon lies in the flow of money. The primary beneficiary of this trend is the head office, as the money ultimately gravitates towards the central office of companies rather than staying within the local community.

&lt;p&gt;for example, assuming you managing to sell the used car and your neighbor sell the fruit. if they buy car from you and you buy fruit from them, you both earn money. however if you buy fruit from big market and they buy car from big company, you both eventually get a loss. it can be applied same in the another goods and another region in the same way.

For example, let’s assume you are managing to sell a used car and your neighbor is selling fruit. If they buy the car from you and you buy fruit from them, both of you earn money. However, if you buy fruit from a big market and they buy a car from a big company, both of you will eventually incur a loss. This principle can be applied to other goods and regions in a similar manner.

&lt;p&gt;in conclusion, company offer the goods in cheaper price than local business which is superficially seems to cost effective and good for everyone. however as long as they don’t distribute their share of money, this will eventually incur the diminish and stagnation of local business and community. sadly individuals can not convince others to refrain from buying big company’s stuff because that usually fail to make everyone to do that simultaneously which result in inconsistence. but government can manage that problem by enacting the law which is why government stands for.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In conclusion, when companies offer goods at a cheaper price compared to local businesses, it may seem cost-effective and beneficial for everyone on the surface. However, if these companies fail to distribute their fair share of money, it will eventually lead to the decline and stagnation of local businesses and communities. Unfortunately, individuals alone cannot persuade others to refrain from buying products from big companies, as such efforts often lack simultaneous action and result in inconsistency. Nevertheless, the government can address this problem by enacting laws, as that is its role and responsibility.

in some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn
&lt;br /&gt;
discuss both views and give your opinion
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
for centuries, difference in money between poverty and wealth has been exsist. there is some contraversy about that problem. i agree with advocating government to restrict the amount people can earn and i will elaborate further on my perspective in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For centuries, the disparity in wealth between poverty and affluence has persisted. This issue has sparked controversy and differing opinions. Personally, I support the idea of government intervention to regulate the amount individuals can earn, and I will delve into my viewpoint in more detail in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;wealthy -&amp;gt; affluence
&lt;br /&gt;
has been exsist -&amp;gt; persisted
&lt;br /&gt;
restrict -&amp;gt; intervention to regulate
&lt;br /&gt;
elaborate on -&amp;gt; delve into
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if some earn most of money, other become tortured form poverty as long as wealthy don’t distribute their portion of money. most people usually think we earn depending on how much we did but normal people don’t have enought opportunity to learn enough. they become poverty because simply don’t know any better. every people doing their best on their own way but metthew effect is getting worser. if someone don’t learn enough, they don’t even know why they can’t learn and they fight each other rather than advocate government to educate them more. so this situation is getting even harder to manage.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If some individuals earn the majority of the money, others are subjected to the torment of poverty, as long as the wealthy fail to distribute their share of wealth. Many people commonly believe that earnings are directly tied to the amount of effort exerted, but ordinary individuals often lack sufficient opportunities to acquire adequate knowledge. They find themselves in poverty simply because they lack awareness of better options. Each person strives to the best of their ability, but the Matthew Effect, wherein the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, worsens. When individuals do not receive adequate education, they remain unaware of the reasons behind their learning difficulties and end up fighting amongst themselves instead of advocating for increased government support in education. Consequently, this situation becomes increasingly challenging to manage.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;most -&amp;gt; majority
&lt;br /&gt;
tortured by -&amp;gt; subjected to the torment

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and also, if we just neglect the disparity between wealthy and poverty, this will eventually resulting in diminishing diversity of human species. if we lose variasity, we become subjective to desaster which aim to specific genetics like gene desease and also if wealthy doesn’t goes together with great personality, our lives becomming more and more bad.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And also, if we neglect the disparity between wealth and poverty, it will eventually result in the diminishing diversity of the human species. When we lose diversity, we become susceptible to disasters that target specific genetics, such as genetic diseases. Additionally, if wealth is not accompanied by a great personality, our lives become increasingly challenging and negative.

Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example to young people
&lt;br /&gt;
to what extent do you agree?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
today, young people usually see agressive news which don’t impose poeple to think deeply but stimulating the peripheral nerves. some argue that emphasizing the superpecial things like appearance and money rather then inner things such as personality resulting in detrimental effect on young people. i will elaborate on my opinion further in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today, young people are often exposed to aggressive news that fails to encourage deep thinking but rather stimulates their superficial senses. Some argue that the excessive emphasis on superficial aspects like appearance and wealth, rather than inner qualities such as personality, has a detrimental effect on young people. I will elaborate further on my opinion in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
every human’s behavior is affected by rewards. that principle bring advertisement company and news to expose people success from superficial aspect rather than from deeply elaborating as most people wants to get the news which is superficial things. we don’t admit the success from ability and elaborate which phenomenon arise from difference of start point among us but that should not make us to prevent from elaborating.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every human’s behavior is influenced by rewards. This principle leads advertising companies and news outlets to highlight superficial aspects of people’s success rather than providing in-depth elaboration. This is because most people are interested in news that focuses on superficial matters. We often fail to acknowledge success based on one’s abilities and the effort put into it. However, we should not overlook success based on ability and depth, even though there may be differences in starting points among individuals. This should not discourage us from seeking and appreciating deeper understanding and elaboration.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our life is about reward. every people’s behavior is based on what they get from their behavior. reward is diverse in form such as money, love, or even knowledge. as long as advertisement company highlight success in superficial things, this will affect young people to think they can get high reward from superficial matters.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our lives revolve around rewards. Every person’s behavior is driven by what they gain from their actions. Rewards appear in diverse forms, such as money, love, or even knowledge. When advertisement companies primarily emphasize success in superficial matters, it influences young people to believe that they can attain significant rewards from superficial aspects.
