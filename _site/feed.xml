An interesting design choice is evident in the left uppermost corner, which now displays gift cards. Below this, a playful touch has been added with a designated play area for visitors. Upon entering the building, which has its entrance situated at the bottom, one is immediately welcomed by a visual treat. Flowers greet visitors both to their immediate right and slightly towards the left center. This display area remains open, allowing for an immersive experience without the need to enter a separate room. Additionally, an office space has been strategically placed in the central right section.

&lt;p&gt;The way to manage attendants is recommended to vary depending on the characteristics of each department. I believe one of the most prominent personality traits in human beings is being active. Active individuals tend to follow their curiosity, leading to improved intelligence compared to others, as well as greater independence because they challenge traditional practices by asking questions. When active individuals are placed in departments that require continuous change and experimentation, they thrive in such environments. However, if they are placed in departments that do not offer such opportunities, they may experience significant stress. Wearing a costume can create a sense of unity and conformity, but it can also constrain divergent thinking, limiting the possibility of questioning and stifling creativity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach to managing attendants should be adapted to suit the specific characteristics of each department. In my view, one of the most prominent personality traits in human beings is being active. Active individuals tend to follow their curiosity, which results in improved intelligence compared to others, and they also exhibit greater independence by questioning conventional practices. When active individuals are assigned to departments that embrace continuous change and experimentation, they thrive in such dynamic environments. However, if they are placed in departments that lack such opportunities, they may experience considerable stress. While wearing a uniform can foster a sense of unity and conformity, it can also limit divergent thinking, restricting the potential for questioning and hindering creativity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between men and women lies in their levels of activity. However, being active has its pros and cons. Active individuals are usually good at math, as it requires curiosity to acquire knowledge that is used to refine existing knowledge by distinguishing between different concepts. On the other hand, they may face challenges when learning languages, as language knowledge is often not directly interconnected. The process of selecting a learning approach itself can be perceived as a waste of time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction between men and women lies in their levels of activity. However, being active comes with its advantages and disadvantages. Active individuals typically excel in math, as it demands curiosity to acquire knowledge and refine existing understanding by differentiating between various concepts. Conversely, they may encounter difficulties in language learning, as language knowledge is often not directly connected. Moreover, the process of choosing a learning approach itself can be perceived as time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent reason for crime lies in the disparity between wealth and poverty. According to game theory, when individuals fail to secure enough resources, they resort to competing with and depriving one another, creating a zero-sum game scenario. Resources can take various forms, and their deficiency not only signifies a lack of money but also a lack of self-esteem. Many people resort to robbery or theft to alleviate their financial struggles, while others engage in online crime and sexual offenses due to a sense of inadequacy. Drug-related problems also arise from the wealth-poverty gap, as pharmaceutical companies illegally sell drugs and simultaneously market medicines that mitigate the drugs’ side effects. Such practices are made possible through lobbying efforts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for crime often stems from the disparity between wealth and poverty. Drawing on game theory, when individuals lack sufficient resources, they may resort to competing and depriving one another, leading to a zero-sum game scenario. These resources can take various forms, and their deficiency not only represents a lack of financial means but also a deficiency in self-esteem. Some people turn to robbery or theft to cope with financial difficulties, while others engage in online crime and sexual offenses driven by feelings of inadequacy. Drug-related issues also arise from the wealth-poverty gap, with pharmaceutical companies involved in illegal drug sales while simultaneously marketing medicines that mitigate the drugs’ side effects through lobbying efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the government sends criminals to jail, they often find alternative ways to engage in criminal activities rather than becoming deterred or reforming. This is because the government fails to address the underlying deficiencies that contribute to their criminal behavior. Simply incarcerating individuals and increasing police presence on the streets does not solve the root problem; it is cost-effective but not a comprehensive solution. The key to eliminating crime lies in education. We have a responsibility to guide individuals in the right direction and we can achieve this by incentivizing learning, such as providing financial rewards when we observe significant progress in their knowledge acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the government may send criminals to jail, many of them still find alternative ways to continue their criminal activities rather than being deterred or reformed. This is because the government often overlooks the underlying issues that contribute to their criminal behavior. Simply putting individuals behind bars and increasing police presence on the streets might offer short-term solutions, but it doesn’t address the root cause comprehensively. The ultimate solution to reducing crime lies in education. We have a responsibility to guide individuals toward the right path, and we can achieve this by incentivizing learning. For instance, providing financial rewards when we observe significant progress in their knowledge acquisition can encourage positive change and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of teachers and parents is to support students in navigating their path towards pursuing happiness. There are numerous ways to pursue happiness, but students often get stuck in just one way because they may not be aware of other options or simply follow what is in front of them. The main role of advisors is to help them broaden their perspective and explore different paths that lead to happiness. Sometimes, you need to encourage them to keep going, and other times, you need to guide them towards better alternatives. If they struggle to adapt to a particular teaching method, you should search for alternative ways to teach. However, it is important not to force them to pursue the path you believe is best, as everyone has different experiences and different ways of finding happiness. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to happiness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of teachers and parents is to provide support and guidance to students as they embark on their journey to pursue happiness. While there are various paths to achieve happiness, students often get stuck in one direction due to limited exposure or simply following the familiar. As advisors, it is essential to help them expand their horizons and explore different avenues leading to happiness. At times, encouragement is necessary to keep them motivated, while other times, gentle guidance can lead them to better alternatives. If a particular teaching method proves challenging for them, it’s crucial to seek alternative approaches to facilitate their learning. However, it’s important not to impose our own beliefs about the best path to happiness, as each individual’s experiences and preferences are unique.

&lt;p&gt;To tackle the issue of increasing obesity rates, there are several approaches we can take. The government can initiate a public nonprofit agency to promote the consumption of low-fat foods. Additionally, individuals can take action by engaging in regular exercise to reduce body fat.

&lt;p&gt;There are some attempts to revert to traditional healthcare methods, which contrasts with modern medical technology. This has created some controversy within the healthcare system, as both approaches have historically been enhanced through experimental results. Traditional methods often involve researching the correlation of organs that may not seem directly related, focusing on the neuro system. On the other hand, modern methods concentrate on directly alleviating abnormal symptoms of specific organs and utilize modern analysis technology to explore peripheral areas known to be correlated with those organs.
While modern technology can address most problems, when faced with unprecedented issues, there is a possibility that traditional methods could prove effective. This highlights the ongoing debate between the existing and new approaches in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As society evolves, there are concerns about losing our traditional customs. However, I firmly believe that embracing transformation and progress is an essential process for improvement. We can let go of corrupted and toxic customs by comparing them with others and adopting well-functioning practices from different cultures. Our customs shouldn’t simply be a mix of various elements but rather a process of referencing and refining practices from different cultures. By doing so, we can preserve the essence of our traditions while incorporating positive changes to adapt to the changing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that building a sky train will help ease traffic congestion. However, the construction of a sky train could potentially lead to environmental pollution, including blocking sunlight with its structures. Additionally, if the increased accessibility to the city accelerates population growth, the issue of traffic jams may not improve, and the disparity between wealth and poverty could result in a lifestyle that fails to enjoy the benefits of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many people believe that constructing a sky train will alleviate traffic congestion, there are potential drawbacks to consider. For instance, the sky train’s structures could cause environmental pollution and obstruct sunlight. Furthermore, if the improved accessibility to the city leads to a surge in population, the traffic congestion issue may persist, and some individuals may not have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of sunlight due to socioeconomic disparities.&lt;/p&gt;

When active individuals are placed in departments that require continuous change and experimentation, they thrive in such environments. However, if they are placed in departments that do not offer such opportunities, they may experience significant stress. Wearing a costume can create a sense of unity and conformity, but it can also constrain divergent thinking, limiting the possibility of questioning and stifling creativity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the improvement of healthcare system, since we become to live longer, society is aging more and more. we suggested numerous solution to address such phenomenon so far. the most prominent suggestion is we can prolong the retirement age so as to leverage elderly’s still vigorous power ,which is due to modernized healthcare system, to the society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the healthcare system continues to advance, our life expectancy increases, resulting in a progressively aging society. Over time, we have proposed numerous solutions to cope with this phenomenon. One of the most prominent suggestions is extending the retirement age, allowing the elderly to contribute their still robust capabilities, thanks to the benefits of modern healthcare, to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;individual and government plays different role each other. individual watch governemnt to not corrupt but government watch individual to not commit crime and hram each other. the good government usually commit to address socialwide problem such as environmental preservation, economic crisis, conflict between nation. and also they can start governmental agency which spesically deals with social problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals and the government each have distinct roles to play in society. While individuals keep an eye on the government to prevent corruption, the government, in turn, monitors individuals to deter crime and harm to others. A well-functioning government takes responsibility for tackling issues that affect society as a whole, such as environmental preservation, economic crises, and international conflicts. Moreover, they have the ability to establish specialized governmental agencies that address these social challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can apply numerous approach to address increasing fat rate. government can start public profit agency to encourage consuming low-fat food. we can decrease our inner fat by regulary training our body. the most important behavior is deter our willing of consuming carbohydrate. because consuming excessive carbohydrate is more detrimental than lazy training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tackle the issue of increasing obesity rates, there are several approaches we can take. The government can initiate a public nonprofit agency to promote the consumption of low-fat foods. Additionally, individuals can take action by engaging in regular exercise to reduce body fat. However, one of the most crucial behaviors to address is curbing our desire for excessive carbohydrate consumption. This is because consuming too many carbohydrates can have more detrimental effects than not being as active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some attempt to revert to traditional healthcare method contrast to modern medical technology, there is some contraversary in healthcare system between existing approach and new approach. even though both methods ,historically, are enhanced through experimental results, traditional method is usually researched about correlation of organs which seems not correlated each other so their methods are related to neuro system. modern method is usually focus on directly alleviate the abnormal symtom of that organ and start searching pheriperal area which is known as correlated with that organ with aid of modern analysis techonology. so most problem can be solved with modern technology but when we encounter unprecedented problem, there is presence of probability that traditional method will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some attempts to revert to traditional healthcare methods, which contrasts with modern medical technology. This has created some controversy within the healthcare system, as both approaches have historically been enhanced through experimental results. Traditional methods often involve researching the correlation of organs that may not seem directly related, focusing on the neuro system. On the other hand, modern methods concentrate on directly alleviating abnormal symptoms of specific organs and utilize modern analysis technology to explore peripheral areas known to be correlated with those organs.
While modern technology can address most problems, when faced with unprecedented issues, there is a possibility that traditional methods could prove effective. This highlights the ongoing debate between the existing and new approaches in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With changing socitey over time, people worry about losing our traditional custom. but i believe pursuing transformation of practice is imperative process to be improved. we can abandon our corrupted and toxical custom by compare with another one and accept their well-functioning practice. our custom doesn’t merely developing to the mixing together but reference another culture and refine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As society evolves, there are concerns about losing our traditional customs. However, I firmly believe that embracing transformation and progress is an essential process for improvement. We can let go of corrupted and toxic customs by comparing them with others and adopting well-functioning practices from different cultures. Our customs shouldn’t simply be a mix of various elements but rather a process of referencing and refining practices from different cultures. By doing so, we can preserve the essence of our traditions while incorporating positive changes to adapt to the changing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the reason why art is important to the society is they reflect our society. when we appreciate another countries culture, we can find out what they are pursuing. especially, when it comes to art, we can put our unexplainable emotion and feelings on that meterial. but as they are hard to explain so hard to remember, when we lose our art, it is easy to forgot few of our own feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art holds significant importance in society because it serves as a reflection of our culture and values. When we admire and appreciate the culture of other countries through art, we gain insight into their aspirations and ideals. Moreover, art offers a unique medium for us to express our unexplainable emotions and feelings, allowing us to connect with the material on a deeper level. However, since these emotions are difficult to articulate, they become challenging to remember. Consequently, when we lose our art, we risk forgetting some of our distinctive characteristics as a society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;many people think build sky train will alleviate the traffic cog. but sky train pose potentional posibility of environmental pollution including shade sunlight. moreover, if they accerlate the increasing population to the city, the the problem of traffic jam doesn’t getting better and the disparity between wealth and poverty result in lifestyle which fail to reach to the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that building a sky train will help ease traffic congestion. However, the construction of a sky train could potentially lead to environmental pollution, including blocking sunlight with its structures. Additionally, if the increased accessibility to the city accelerates population growth, the issue of traffic jams may not improve, and the disparity between wealth and poverty could result in a lifestyle that fails to enjoy the benefits of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the time human used to work as primary industry such as peasantry, fisher, woodsman and more. However, since human’s resources accumulated over time, the effort they have to put for sustaining basic lives decreases. they start to work as secondary industry and third industry which had been enabled as human can commute far from home. According to investigation conducted in Callifornia, United States, in 1950, More than 50% of working population engage in primary industry but in 1990, Less than 20% of working population still serve for primary industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when humans used to work in the primary industry, which included agriculture, fishing, forestry, and more. However, as human resources accumulated over time, the effort required to sustain basic livelihoods decreased. This led people to shift towards the secondary and tertiary industries, enabled by the ability to commute farther from home. According to an investigation conducted in California, United States, in 1950, over 50% of the working population was engaged in the primary industry. However, by 1990, less than 20% of the working population remained in the primary industry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these days, consequently, with the emerging of fourth industry, numerous people don’t even commute but work at home. people begin to know the power of computer is significant alongside to utilize internet. for example, they start advertising, make movie, share information, communicate each other immediately by chatting and calling. and also they can analysis data with AI(artificial intelligence) even though which doesn’t need internet. which also enabling us to work numerous things at the same time and allow us to yield profit as long as our ability can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent times, with the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution, many people no longer need to commute but instead work from home. People have come to recognize the significant power of computers and the utilization of the internet. For example, they engage in activities such as advertising, movie-making, information sharing, and immediate communication through chat and calls. Additionally, they can analyze data with artificial intelligence (AI) even without internet connectivity. This enables individuals to multitask and pursue profit based on their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, we scrutinized affect of the modernization of technology on our work place. As times goes on, our work style transform to require less commute distance and enabling us to work depends on our personal ability rather than where we born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, we have examined the impact of technological modernization on our workplaces. As time passes, our work style is evolving to require less commuting distance and allowing us to work based on our personal abilities rather than being constrained by our birthplace&lt;/p&gt;
