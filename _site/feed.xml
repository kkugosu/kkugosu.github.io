&lt;p&gt;The term “active” in “active learning” simply refers to the ability to choose the way we learn. and there have been numerous method which is included in active learning especially many branch of generative models such as RL and GAN. And due to their learning style, we can embody curiosity through these algorithms. You can see the implementation of many different uncertainty estimation methods through Bayesian neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been various valuable attempts to construct plausible AI models that not only mimic human intelligence but also pursue the ultimate goal of true intelligence. While neural networks appear to effectively learn various patterns, we cannot guarantee that what they have learned represents optimized knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my previous post, the optimization of their learned knowledge depends on the PAC-Bayes bound. 
Additionally, although I haven’t mentioned it yet, we can also simply utilize optimization methods to ensure if the knowledge they have learned is optimized or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinguishing factor of reinforcement learning (RL) from other active learning methods is its ability to effectively lower the PAC-Bayes bound by reducing the hypothesis space through the Markov assumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="theory" /><summary type="html">What i suppose to write about today is reinforcement learning which is one of the kinds of active learning.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">useful expression 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/hobby/2023/05/28/useful-expression-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="useful expression 2" /><published>2023-05-28T16:10:33+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-28T16:10:33+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/hobby/2023/05/28/useful%20expression%202</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/hobby/2023/05/28/useful-expression-2.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There has been numerous elaboration to find out like “what is ai”, “how can we build most plausable ai” and “what is intelligence” and lots of paper successfully gave us deep inspiration about fundamental implementation of ai. eventhough there has been enourmous pregress in AI, we still can’t explain why we have curiousity and still failed to make how to make model to learn maximizing pac bayes bound.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wanna write about the most fundamental and important concepts we encounter when we first learn about AI which are namely bias and variance.
actually these two concept imply opposite things bias means assumption and variance means non-assumption which is like even though we learn something which works simillar as preliminary learned, we should not assume that will works simillary.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The matter at hand is, we have to strike a balance between two concept. for example, when you take the ramen and their color was red, you can think every red food is spicy if you are really biasd. but you have to be more specific in the real life and take that as depending on the context. however you should have bias to some extent. when you learned something from specific situation, you should be able to adapt that principle for another situation as well.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The representative theory which discuss about this is called PAC and we usually employ PAC-bayes bounds in academic paper. and also there has been attempts which aim to make model to autonomously strike a balance by themselves which is called autoML.
There are many different kinds of techniques which is included in autoML framework called HPO(hyper parameter optimization), NAS(neural architecture search), meta learning and more.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many kinds of PAC-Bayes bounds, and a common characteristic among them is that the bound decreases as the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the posterior and prior distributions decreases ,just if you don’t care about estimated risk of your model, or as the number of data for learning increases.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HPO and NAS is method of finding appropriate hypothetical space and meta learning is method of increasing number of data for learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="theory" /><summary type="html">With advancement of ai, we can see plenty of conspicuous model these days which is usually comes from GAN and RL both of which are active learning model.

&lt;br /&gt;
some employers want to be able to contact their staff at all times, even on holidays
&lt;br /&gt;
does this development have more advantages than disadvantages?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as society becomming diverse, every individuals are getting to serve their own role rather than doing everything. as our role is getting diverse, we need to communicate each other to accomplish big project. some want to communicate more frequently and i will delve into my perspective in detail in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As society becomes more diverse, individuals are increasingly taking on specific roles instead of trying to do everything themselves. With this diversification of roles, effective communication becomes crucial for accomplishing big projects. Some individuals prefer to communicate more frequently, and I will further elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;getting -&amp;gt; increasingly
&lt;br /&gt;
some -&amp;gt; some individuals
&lt;br /&gt;
serve role -&amp;gt; taking on role
&lt;br /&gt;
their own -&amp;gt; specific
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is important to see things from another person’s point of view as it will prevent works to be concentrated on few persons resulting in improving the performance doing a project as a whole. moreover we can prevent ourselves from doing unnessarily elaborate by anticipate the workflow. for example, when we build website, if developer already know manager don’t usually use customer service, they don’t need to make that window.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Considering things from another person’s perspective is crucial as it prevents work from being biased towards a few individuals, leading to improved performance by ensuring the collaboration of all team members on a project. Additionally, anticipating the workflow allows us to avoid unnecessary elaboration. For example, when building a website, if a developer knows that the manager rarely utilizes customer service, they can omit creating that specific page.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;concentrated -&amp;gt; biased, skewed
&lt;br /&gt;
concentrate 는 좀더 추상적인
&lt;br /&gt;
bias skew는 물리적인
&lt;br /&gt;
expect -&amp;gt; anticipate
&lt;br /&gt;
expect = 결과물에 대한 예상
&lt;br /&gt;
anticipate 미래의 사건
&lt;br /&gt;
use -&amp;gt; utilize
&lt;br /&gt;
don’t make -&amp;gt; omit
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but if there is inequality of information or manager is lake of consideration, and also if they don’t compensate enough money to staff, act of sharing is becomming meaningless and that even can cause employee to give leeway to get nagging. for example, assumimg employee talk with employer on weekends and employer is lake of considerate, they probably ask employee to work more without money.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But if there is a lack of information equality or the manager lacks consideration, and if they don’t provide sufficient compensation to the staff, the act of sharing becomes meaningless. This can even lead the employer to justify nagging. For example, if an employee talks to their employer on weekends and the employer lacks consideration, they may ask the employee to work more without providing additional compensation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
in conclution, as long as we fail to see things from other people’s side, like modern society, it is better to work just for our given portion.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In conclusion, if we continue to overlook other people’s perspectives, similar to modern society, it is advisable to focus on fulfilling our own assigned roles. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;as long as -&amp;gt; if we continue to
&lt;br /&gt;
it is better to -&amp;gt; it is advisable to
&lt;br /&gt;

due to the development and rapid expansion of supermarkets in some countries, many small, local business are unable to compete. some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities

capitalism is great concept in global society and it is great motivation of making people to work hard. but nowadays with advancement, some company are starting to provide stuff more easily and which leads them to earn every money instead of local company. i will delve my perspective in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Capitalism is a great concept in global society and serves as a significant motivation for people to work hard. However, with advancements in technology, certain companies have begun to provide goods and services more easily, resulting in their dominance over local businesses and the accumulation of vast wealth. I will further explore my perspective on this matter in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USA boston media investigation of changing number of local business and average income for a last 50years illuminates these two indicators are diminishing at the same time which means these have positive relation each other. the reason behind this phenomenon is arised from flow of money. the man who benefit most from this is head office which means money is eventually goes to the head office of company not local. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The investigation conducted by the media in Boston, USA, on the changing number of local businesses and average income over the past 50 years reveals a simultaneous decline in both indicators, indicating a positive correlation between them. The underlying reason behind this phenomenon lies in the flow of money. The primary beneficiary of this trend is the head office, as the money ultimately gravitates towards the central office of companies rather than staying within the local community.

&lt;p&gt;for example, assuming you managing to sell the used car and your neighbor sell the fruit. if they buy car from you and you buy fruit from them, you both earn money. however if you buy fruit from big market and they buy car from big company, you both eventually get a loss. it can be applied same in the another goods and another region in the same way.

For example, let’s assume you are managing to sell a used car and your neighbor is selling fruit. If they buy the car from you and you buy fruit from them, both of you earn money. However, if you buy fruit from a big market and they buy a car from a big company, both of you will eventually incur a loss. This principle can be applied to other goods and regions in a similar manner.

&lt;p&gt;in conclusion, company offer the goods in cheaper price than local business which is superficially seems to cost effective and good for everyone. however as long as they don’t distribute their share of money, this will eventually incur the diminish and stagnation of local business and community. sadly individuals can not convince others to refrain from buying big company’s stuff because that usually fail to make everyone to do that simultaneously which result in inconsistence. but government can manage that problem by enacting the law which is why government stands for.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In conclusion, when companies offer goods at a cheaper price compared to local businesses, it may seem cost-effective and beneficial for everyone on the surface. However, if these companies fail to distribute their fair share of money, it will eventually lead to the decline and stagnation of local businesses and communities. Unfortunately, individuals alone cannot persuade others to refrain from buying products from big companies, as such efforts often lack simultaneous action and result in inconsistency. Nevertheless, the government can address this problem by enacting laws, as that is its role and responsibility.
