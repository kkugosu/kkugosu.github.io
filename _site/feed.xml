&lt;br /&gt;
in some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn
&lt;br /&gt;
discuss both views and give your opinion
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
for centuries, difference in money between poverty and wealth has been exsist. there is some contraversy about that problem. i agree with advocating government to restrict the amount people can earn and i will elaborate further on my perspective in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For centuries, the disparity in wealth between poverty and affluence has persisted. This issue has sparked controversy and differing opinions. Personally, I support the idea of government intervention to regulate the amount individuals can earn, and I will delve into my viewpoint in more detail in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;wealthy -&amp;gt; affluence
&lt;br /&gt;
has been exsist -&amp;gt; persisted
&lt;br /&gt;
restrict -&amp;gt; intervention to regulate
&lt;br /&gt;
elaborate on -&amp;gt; delve into
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if some earn most of money, other become tortured form poverty as long as wealthy don’t distribute their portion of money. most people usually think we earn depending on how much we did but normal people don’t have enought opportunity to learn enough. they become poverty because simply don’t know any better. every people doing their best on their own way but metthew effect is getting worser. if someone don’t learn enough, they don’t even know why they can’t learn and they fight each other rather than advocate government to educate them more. so this situation is getting even harder to manage.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If some individuals earn the majority of the money, others are subjected to the torment of poverty, as long as the wealthy fail to distribute their share of wealth. Many people commonly believe that earnings are directly tied to the amount of effort exerted, but ordinary individuals often lack sufficient opportunities to acquire adequate knowledge. They find themselves in poverty simply because they lack awareness of better options. Each person strives to the best of their ability, but the Matthew Effect, wherein the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, worsens. When individuals do not receive adequate education, they remain unaware of the reasons behind their learning difficulties and end up fighting amongst themselves instead of advocating for increased government support in education. Consequently, this situation becomes increasingly challenging to manage.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;most -&amp;gt; majority
&lt;br /&gt;
tortured by -&amp;gt; subjected to the torment
&lt;br /&gt;
don’t -&amp;gt; fail
&lt;br /&gt;
portion of -&amp;gt; share of
&lt;br /&gt;
depending on -&amp;gt; tied to
&lt;br /&gt;
how much we did -&amp;gt; effort exerted
&lt;br /&gt;
don’t know -&amp;gt; remain unaware of
&lt;br /&gt;
fight each other -&amp;gt; fighting amongst themselves
&lt;br /&gt;
harder -&amp;gt; increasingly challenging
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and also, if we just neglect the disparity between wealthy and poverty, this will eventually resulting in diminishing diversity of human species. if we lose variasity, we become subjective to desaster which aim to specific genetics like gene desease and also if wealthy doesn’t goes together with great personality, our lives becomming more and more bad.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And also, if we neglect the disparity between wealth and poverty, it will eventually result in the diminishing diversity of the human species. When we lose diversity, we become susceptible to disasters that target specific genetics, such as genetic diseases. Additionally, if wealth is not accompanied by a great personality, our lives become increasingly challenging and negative.
&lt;br /&gt;
subjective to -&amp;gt; susceptible to, subject to

&lt;br /&gt; 
Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example to young people
&lt;br /&gt;
to what extent do you agree?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
today, young people usually see agressive news which don’t impose poeple to think deeply but stimulating the peripheral nerves. some argue that emphasizing the superpecial things like appearance and money rather then inner things such as personality resulting in detrimental effect on young people. i will elaborate on my opinion further in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today, young people are often exposed to aggressive news that fails to encourage deep thinking but rather stimulates their superficial senses. Some argue that the excessive emphasis on superficial aspects like appearance and wealth, rather than inner qualities such as personality, has a detrimental effect on young people. I will elaborate further on my opinion in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;peripheral nerves -&amp;gt; superficial senses
&lt;br /&gt;
superpecial things -&amp;gt; superficial aspects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
every human’s behavior is affected by rewards. that principle bring advertisement company and news to expose people success from superficial aspect rather than from deeply elaborating as most people wants to get the news which is superficial things. we don’t admit the success from ability and elaborate which phenomenon arise from difference of start point among us but that should not make us to prevent from elaborating.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every human’s behavior is influenced by rewards. This principle leads advertising companies and news outlets to highlight superficial aspects of people’s success rather than providing in-depth elaboration. This is because most people are interested in news that focuses on superficial matters. We often fail to acknowledge success based on one’s abilities and the effort put into it. However, we should not overlook success based on ability and depth, even though there may be differences in starting points among individuals. This should not discourage us from seeking and appreciating deeper understanding and elaboration.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bring -&amp;gt; leads
&lt;br /&gt;

success from elaborate -&amp;gt; success based on effort put into it
&lt;br /&gt;
prevent us from -&amp;gt; discourage us from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our life is about reward. every people’s behavior is based on what they get from their behavior. reward is diverse in form such as money, love, or even knowledge. as long as advertisement company highlight success in superficial things, this will affect young people to think they can get high reward from superficial matters.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our lives revolve around rewards. Every person’s behavior is driven by what they gain from their actions. Rewards appear in diverse forms, such as money, love, or even knowledge. When advertisement companies primarily emphasize success in superficial matters, it influences young people to believe that they can attain significant rewards from superficial aspects.

&lt;br /&gt;
some people fail in school but end up sucessful in life
why do you think that is the case?
&lt;br /&gt;
what is the most important thing to succeed in life?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
generally people believe successful in school should be prerequisite of successful in life. However there were always some who was not successful in school but in life. i will write my inference of the reason of this situation further in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Generally, people believe that success in school is a prerequisite for success in life. However, there have always been individuals who were not successful in school but still managed to achieve success in life. In the following paragraph, I will provide my inference on the reasons behind this situation.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;prerequisite of -&amp;gt; prerequisite for
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
reason of this situation -&amp;gt; reason behind this situation
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the regular education of school is stands for keep the human species from unnesscerly excessive explore by providing guideline. but as time progresses, world’s gaining diversity resulting in making lots of way to live. as we can’t cover and guide every case by regular education there are occer some cases who success with their own way didn’t following the regular course.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The regular education system in schools aims to prevent unnecessary and excessive exploration by providing guidelines. However, as the world progresses, it becomes increasingly diverse, giving rise to various paths in life. Since the regular education system cannot cover and guide every individual case, there are instances where individuals find success by following their own unique paths, deviating from the conventional course.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;resulting in -&amp;gt; giving rise to
&lt;br /&gt;
lots of way -&amp;gt; various path
&lt;br /&gt;
there are occur -&amp;gt; there are instances
&lt;br /&gt;
didn’t following the regular course -&amp;gt; deviating from the conventional course
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now we can come up with one question about what is important to be successful. i believe the most important thing is becoming confident. since we live in different environment, we are getting our own strength in our life. every our behavior has personal significant in their pursuit of happiness moreover If someone focuses on one skill, we can identify the area in which they are optimized using the maximum principle of convex optimization theory. If you come across someone who is optimized in a particular area, you can ascertain their focus on one skill through the strong separation theorem of convex optimization theory. but we can only become extreme to one area through stop comparing ourselves with another because we can easily loose our confidence by that behavior.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, we can raise a question about what is important for success. I believe that the most crucial factor is developing confidence. As we live in diverse environments, we cultivate our own strengths in life. Each of our behaviors holds personal significance in our pursuit of happiness. Furthermore, If someone focuses on one skill, we can identify the area in which they are optimized using the maximum principle of convex optimization theory. If you come across someone who is optimized in a particular area, you can ascertain their focus on one skill through the strong separation theorem of convex optimization theory. However, we can only become truly exceptional in one area by refraining from comparing ourselves to others, as such comparisons can easily undermine our confidence.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;come up with -&amp;gt; raise
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
the government should allocate more funding to teaching sciences rather than subjects in order for a country to develop and progress
&lt;br /&gt;
to what extent do you agree?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
as the time progresses, the world is becomming globalize due to the advancement of transportation system and online platform. but most crucial factor behind all this change is improvement of techonology over time. some advocate goverment to fund more in techonology through weighting more in teaching in regular education. i will provide detailed explaination of my perspective on this matter further in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As time progresses, the world is becoming more globalized due to advancements in transportation systems and online platforms. However, the most crucial factor driving these changes is the continuous improvement of technology. Some argue that the government should invest more in technology by giving it greater importance in regular education. In the following paragraph, I will provide a detailed explanation of my perspective on this matter.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;advancement of -&amp;gt; advancements in 
&lt;br /&gt;
factor behind -&amp;gt; factor driving
&lt;br /&gt;
improvement of techonology over time -&amp;gt; continuous improvement of technology
&lt;br /&gt;
weighting more in -&amp;gt; giving it greater importance
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even though every imporvement is due to techonological advancement, that doesn’t bring hapiness of human species. as difference between wealthy and poverty getting worse, persentage of homeless is rather getting more than before which phenomenon is occered from loophole of policy.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even though every improvement is due to technological advancement, that doesn’t necessarily bring happiness to the human species. As the difference between wealth and poverty worsens, the percentage of homelessness is increasing rather than decreasing, which is a phenomenon occurring due to policy loopholes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;getting worse -&amp;gt; worsen
&lt;br /&gt;
which phenomenon occered from-&amp;gt; which is a phenomenon occering due to
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;government’s excessive influence to some area is potentially problematic. for instance, in korea, government’s excessively support in medical science brings lots of medical accident because there are lots of people who wanna practice surgery even though they are not qualified or not interested in help people sincerely and even worse, government makes lots of loophole in the law in the medical field with the reason of assitance of medical field.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Government’s excessive influence in certain areas can pose potential problems. For instance, in Korea, the government’s excessive support in the field of medical science has resulted in numerous medical accidents. This is due to the presence of individuals who are eager to perform surgeries without proper qualifications or genuine dedication to helping people. Furthermore, the government’s creation of loopholes in medical laws, under the guise of assisting the medical field, exacerbates the situation.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;some -&amp;gt; certain
&lt;br /&gt;
imply -&amp;gt; pose
&lt;br /&gt;
lots of -&amp;gt; numerous
&lt;br /&gt;
interested in help sincerily -&amp;gt; genuine dedication
&lt;br /&gt;
with the reason of -&amp;gt; under the guise of, under the pretense of
&lt;br /&gt;
worsen -&amp;gt; exacerbates
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i believe the most important thing is, government have to assist people to crave out their own way through balance the investment on each field not invest excessively on the just few field as happiness is achieved through preventing metthew effect regardless of advancement of techonology.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So I believe the most important thing is that the government assists people in carving out their own path by balancing investments in each field, rather than investing excessively in just a few areas. Happiness is achieved through preventing the Matthew effect, regardless of technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;assist people to crave out -&amp;gt; assist people in craving out (people who are carving out)

The world is becoming increasingly globalized, and this is evident not only in the advancement of transportation systems but also in the growing significance of online platforms that facilitate the exchange of information. Some argue that computer education should be included in the regular education system in response to this trend.

respecting individual’s choice is important as every one’s choice has their own meaning in aspect of chasing the happiness. even though we have to keep that kinds of attitude, sometimes we have to compel some extent of guideline to prevent human species from falling in sub optimization because sometimes we choose difficult way because we purely don’t know any better.

Computer science plays a vital role in addressing such challenges, as it allows us to learn from the lives of others through online platforms, much like any other regular subject. For example, proficiency in mathematics fosters logical and rational thinking, while literacy and computer science skills enhance communication abilities. These are the reasons why computer education is an essential component of a well-rounded education system.

As time progresses, the world is becoming more globalized, making it easier for us to visit and communicate with other countries. Unlike in the past, we now have the opportunity to compare our own culture with that of different countries, allowing us to revise and improve our own cultural practices. Through international exchange visits, we can gain a deeper understanding of other cultures and learn valuable lessons from them. I will elaborate on my perspective on international exchange visits in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you choose to live in another country, there will be associated costs such as finding a place to stay, purchasing airplane tickets, and potentially dealing with higher food prices in wealthier countries. You will also need to familiarize yourself with the transportation system and arrange for internet connectivity. Additionally, making friends might be challenging due to differences in cultural background and racial diversity. Language proficiency, particularly in English, can also be a crucial factor in establishing social connections even if either you or your friends are not fluent in it.

even though every disadvantage arise from living in another country, advantages are still seems to cover every disadvantages. maybe it can be hard to study in that situation due to busy of making yourself familierize to that environment. but most of all, you can learn plenty of another cultures through that processes.

some people think that a person can never understand the culture of a country unless they speak the language.
&lt;br /&gt;
do you agree with this opinion?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
we sometimes can see the argument that says languages have only few origins.however, with the time progression, human species have gained the diversity in language to meet each other’s needs of expression which varies across the country. this development bring languages to be interwined with culture. someone argue we can’t learn another culture unless learning language. i will elaborate my perspective of view with this argument in the following paragraph further.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We sometimes encounter the argument that languages have only a few origins. However, as time has progressed, the human species has gained linguistic diversity to fulfill the varied needs of expression across different countries. This development has resulted in languages becoming intertwined with culture. Some argue that we cannot truly understand another culture without learning its language. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding this argument
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it can be difficult to learn another countries culture without learning their language because we can see their priority from way to talk. when their country is surrounded by sea, they are used to use the term about ship, fish. when their country is located in the north part of earth, they are used to use language about snow, blizzard. their language is probably developed to that way so as to express details about their important things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It can be difficult to understand another country’s culture without learning their language, as their language reveals their priorities and preferences. For instance, if a country is surrounded by sea, their language may incorporate terms specific to ships and fish. Similarly, if a country is located in the northern part of the Earth, their language may include words specific to snow and blizzards. These linguistic nuances are likely developed to express the important aspects of their environment and daily life
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
even though languages are developed from common origins, they have been shaped by different countries in order to meet human needs. since england conquar the substantial numbers of countries, making them as colony under control, huge number of countries have been using english as mother toung. in contemporary world, this thing at that time resulting in making english as global language around the world. some sientists argue that all people will use english eventually and i will explain my perspective in the following paragraph further.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even though languages have common origins, they have been shaped by different countries to meet human needs. Due to England’s conquest of numerous countries and their colonization, a significant number of nations have adopted English as their mother tongue. In the contemporary world, this historical development has led to English becoming a global language. Some scientists argue that eventually, everyone will use English. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding this viewpoint.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;using same language as mother toung around the world can make us to communicate more easily which enabling us to enhance techonology more fastely. however this can be problem since that development doesn’t necessarily resulting in language becomming optimized to our needs to expression. if we loose variety by choosing one language, when are in situation which we needs of express something which can’t accomplished by english, we have no way to express that due to eradicate another languages. this phenomenon is called model collapse in ai terms.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Using the same language as a mother tongue around the world can make communication easier, enabling faster technological advancements. However, this can also be problematic as such development does not necessarily lead to the language becoming optimized for our expressive needs. If we lose linguistic diversity by adopting a single language, we may find ourselves in situations where we need to express something that cannot be adequately conveyed in English. In such cases, we would have no means to express those ideas because we have already eradicated other languages. This phenomenon is referred to as “model collapse” in AI terms.

&lt;br /&gt;
throughout human’s history, we struggle to learn another language to communicate with another country to fulfill each other’s needs. as computer science have grown up especially artificial intelligence, computer start learning multiple language together resulting in becoming capable of translating. today, some people even say our need to learn foreign language becomming deminishing. i’m not agree with them and will explain the reason in the following paragraph further.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout human history, we have strived to learn different languages in order to communicate with people from other countries and fulfill each other’s needs. With the advancement of computer science, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, computers have started to learn multiple languages simultaneously, enabling them to perform translation tasks. Today, some people argue that our need to learn foreign languages is diminishing. However, I disagree with this perspective and will further explain the reasons in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Eventhough languages came from just few common origin, as Language is used as one of means of life of human, it is improved over the time according to human needs. today’s language varies depend on the country and they also reflect their culture. we can understand another’s culture by learning language not only make us to commmunicate easily.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revised&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even though languages have common origins, they have evolved over time to meet the diverse needs of human life. Language serves as a fundamental tool for communication and has been shaped by different countries and cultures. By learning a language, we not only gain the ability to communicate more easily but also develop a deeper understanding of another culture.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;from few origins -&amp;gt; have common origins
&lt;br /&gt;
language is improved -&amp;gt; language have evolved

&lt;br /&gt;
can understand -&amp;gt; develop deeper understanding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and also there is big problem when we don’t learn language anymore and fully resort at translater. we can’t supervise whether ai translate language properly or not which will arise or incurring misunderstanding across the country.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And also, there is a significant problem when we no longer learn languages and solely rely on translators. We are unable to supervise whether AI translates languages accurately, which can lead to misunderstandings across countries.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in conclution, we have necessairly to learn foreign language because of disadvantages occered from not learning them and advantages which are unable to be accomplished from simply using translater.
