&lt;p&gt;the building has been built present days containing every amenity relevent to swimming pool, reception, cafe, changingroom, fitness centre. before that building, there was cafe and reception at the same place as now, the western north part of building, also same as pool, which was initially located northeastern and now situated northen area of building. changing room was initially located beneath reception but it moved little bit eastward, meanwhile tennis court moved westward to outside of building , where car park was located, and fitness centre is constructed at the place which tennis court has been.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the current building, equipped with modern amenities such as a swimming pool, reception area, cafe, changing rooms, and a fitness center, stands as a testament to recent development. Previously, the cafe and reception were situated in the same location as they are today, in the western-northern part of the building. The pool, which was originally in the northeastern section, has since been relocated to the northern part of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing rooms have also seen a shift; originally placed directly beneath the reception, they have now moved slightly to the east. The tennis court has been relocated to the west, outside of the building, taking over what used to be a car park area. In the tennis court’s former location, a new fitness center has been constructed.

another side of map was composed of houses and farmland, also southen half of which was farmland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the school located below the main road occupied only the eastern half of the map. Of this section, the southern half was designated as a playground, while the remainder was occupied by the school building. On the other side of the map, the area was made up of houses and farmland, with the southern half being exclusively farmland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the school expanded westward to occupy the entire area of the map. The western portion was developed to include a car park, a science block, and a sports field. The sports field was constructed on the exact spot where the farmland used to be. Additionally, the car park took up the western half of the remaining area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2010, the sports field and playground had been consolidated on the right side of the area, with the playground occupying the larger section. Meanwhile, the car park was extended southward into the space that was initially used by the sports field.&lt;/p&gt;

The extracted virgin oil undergoes additional refinement. This involves processes like separation or decantation to ensure purity and quality. Finally, the refined oil is either carefully stored in tanks or dispatched to factories for additional post-processing stages.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process begins at sea, where fish are caught using nets. Once caught, the fish are transported to a port. Upon arrival, they are immediately stored in a freezing environment to preserve their freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
we store them freezing and over time, we thaw them in fresh water and cut open.
and then we coloring them as yellow in the saltwater, smoking.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After some time, these frozen fish are thawed in fresh water and then gutted. The next step involves coloring the fish yellow by immersing them in saltwater and subjecting them to a smoking process. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Once this is completed, the fish are frozen again, this time at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, ensuring they remain in a preserved state. They are then stored accordingly until they are ready for distribution.

&lt;br /&gt;
The final step in the process involves delivering these preserved fish to fish shops, where they are ultimately sold to customers. This comprehensive journey from the sea to the shop ensures that the fish remain fresh and high in quality for the end consumer.

These houses will be constructed adjacent to the road, situated between the proposed bridge and the existing roundabout.

&lt;br /&gt;
The illustrated map showcases the dynamic changes in a river basin over three distinct periods: 1780, 1860, and 2000.

there was large farm region adjacent to the river at the 1780 but the area of it decreases over the time and finally dissappeared at 2000. also same thing happened for the woods located at the right southen part of the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1780, a vast farming region flanked the river, but this area progressively shrank and had completely vanished by 2000. A similar fate befell the woods located in the southern part of the map, which also diminished over time.

and there was not bridge over the river but it constructed at 1860 and still maintained at 2000. in addition, few shop appeared along the river. there was only small resident which is composed of 100homes but it increases over time, becoming 200homes at 1860s and finally 500homes at 2000s. when 1860, load appeared to connect between homes and river and it expanded to connect schools and sport field which appeared at the location which wood has been to.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Initially, there was no bridge crossing the river. However, one was constructed in 1860 and remained in use by 2000. Alongside this, a few shops began to appear near the riverbank. The residential area, initially a small community of around 100 homes in 1780, experienced substantial growth. By the 1860s, it had doubled to 200 homes and by 2000, it had expanded to 500 homes. In 1860, a road was introduced to connect the homes with the river, and over time, this road extended to newly established schools and a sports field. These new developments occupied the space where the woods once stood.

Both types of tea undergo similar initial steps. They are first pan-fried, a step crucial for the inactivation of enzymes. This is followed by rolling. Subsequently, the teas are sun-dried, resulting in loose raw tea.

For the creation of vintage Pu-erh raw tea, the loose tea is compressed into Pu-erh raw tea cakes and then stored for an extended period. On the other hand, to produce Pu-erh ripe tea, the tea undergoes fermentation using mold before being compressed.
