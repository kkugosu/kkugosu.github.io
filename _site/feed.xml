&lt;br /&gt;
some employers want to be able to contact their staff at all times, even on holidays
&lt;br /&gt;
does this development have more advantages than disadvantages?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as society becomming diverse, every individuals are getting to serve their own role rather than doing everything. as our role is getting diverse, we need to communicate each other to accomplish big project. some want to communicate more frequently and i will delve into my perspective in detail in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As society becomes more diverse, individuals are increasingly taking on specific roles instead of trying to do everything themselves. With this diversification of roles, effective communication becomes crucial for accomplishing big projects. Some individuals prefer to communicate more frequently, and I will further elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;getting -&amp;gt; increasingly
&lt;br /&gt;
some -&amp;gt; some individuals
&lt;br /&gt;
serve role -&amp;gt; taking on role
&lt;br /&gt;
their own -&amp;gt; specific
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is important to see things from another person’s point of view as it will prevent works to be concentrated on few persons resulting in improving the performance doing a project as a whole. moreover we can prevent ourselves from doing unnessarily elaborate by anticipate the workflow. for example, when we build website, if developer already know manager don’t usually use customer service, they don’t need to make that window.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Considering things from another person’s perspective is crucial as it prevents work from being biased towards a few individuals, leading to improved performance by ensuring the collaboration of all team members on a project. Additionally, anticipating the workflow allows us to avoid unnecessary elaboration. For example, when building a website, if a developer knows that the manager rarely utilizes customer service, they can omit creating that specific page.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;concentrated -&amp;gt; biased, skewed
&lt;br /&gt;
concentrate 는 좀더 추상적인
&lt;br /&gt;
bias skew는 물리적인
&lt;br /&gt;
expect -&amp;gt; anticipate
&lt;br /&gt;
expect = 결과물에 대한 예상
&lt;br /&gt;
anticipate 미래의 사건
&lt;br /&gt;
use -&amp;gt; utilize
&lt;br /&gt;
don’t make -&amp;gt; omit
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but if there is inequality of information or manager is lake of consideration, and also if they don’t compensate enough money to staff, act of sharing is becomming meaningless and that even can cause employee to give leeway to get nagging. for example, assumimg employee talk with employer on weekends and employer is lake of considerate, they probably ask employee to work more without money.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But if there is a lack of information equality or the manager lacks consideration, and if they don’t provide sufficient compensation to the staff, the act of sharing becomes meaningless. This can even lead the employer to justify nagging. For example, if an employee talks to their employer on weekends and the employer lacks consideration, they may ask the employee to work more without providing additional compensation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
in conclution, as long as we fail to see things from other people’s side, like modern society, it is better to work just for our given portion.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In conclusion, if we continue to overlook other people’s perspectives, similar to modern society, it is advisable to focus on fulfilling our own assigned roles. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;as long as -&amp;gt; if we continue to

due to the development and rapid expansion of supermarkets in some countries, many small, local business are unable to compete. some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities

capitalism is great concept in global society and it is great motivation of making people to work hard. but nowadays with advancement, some company are starting to provide stuff more easily and which leads them to earn every money instead of local company. i will delve my perspective in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Capitalism is a great concept in global society and serves as a significant motivation for people to work hard. However, with advancements in technology, certain companies have begun to provide goods and services more easily, resulting in their dominance over local businesses and the accumulation of vast wealth. I will further explore my perspective on this matter in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;USA boston media investigation of changing number of local business and average income for a last 50years illuminates these two indicators are diminishing at the same time which means these have positive relation each other. the reason behind this phenomenon is arised from flow of money. the man who benefit most from this is head office which means money is eventually goes to the head office of company not local.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The investigation conducted by the media in Boston, USA, on the changing number of local businesses and average income over the past 50 years reveals a simultaneous decline in both indicators, indicating a positive correlation between them. The underlying reason behind this phenomenon lies in the flow of money. The primary beneficiary of this trend is the head office, as the money ultimately gravitates towards the central office of companies rather than staying within the local community.

&lt;p&gt;for example, assuming you managing to sell the used car and your neighbor sell the fruit. if they buy car from you and you buy fruit from them, you both earn money. however if you buy fruit from big market and they buy car from big company, you both eventually get a loss. it can be applied same in the another goods and another region in the same way.

For example, let’s assume you are managing to sell a used car and your neighbor is selling fruit. If they buy the car from you and you buy fruit from them, both of you earn money. However, if you buy fruit from a big market and they buy a car from a big company, both of you will eventually incur a loss. This principle can be applied to other goods and regions in a similar manner.

&lt;p&gt;in conclusion, company offer the goods in cheaper price than local business which is superficially seems to cost effective and good for everyone. however as long as they don’t distribute their share of money, this will eventually incur the diminish and stagnation of local business and community. sadly individuals can not convince others to refrain from buying big company’s stuff because that usually fail to make everyone to do that simultaneously which result in inconsistence. but government can manage that problem by enacting the law which is why government stands for.

In conclusion, when companies offer goods at a cheaper price compared to local businesses, it may seem cost-effective and beneficial for everyone on the surface. However, if these companies fail to distribute their fair share of money, it will eventually lead to the decline and stagnation of local businesses and communities. Unfortunately, individuals alone cannot persuade others to refrain from buying products from big companies, as such efforts often lack simultaneous action and result in inconsistency. Nevertheless, the government can address this problem by enacting laws, as that is its role and responsibility.

in some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn
&lt;br /&gt;
discuss both views and give your opinion
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
for centuries, difference in money between poverty and wealth has been exsist. there is some contraversy about that problem. i agree with advocating government to restrict the amount people can earn and i will elaborate further on my perspective in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For centuries, the disparity in wealth between poverty and affluence has persisted. This issue has sparked controversy and differing opinions. Personally, I support the idea of government intervention to regulate the amount individuals can earn, and I will delve into my viewpoint in more detail in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;wealthy -&amp;gt; affluence
&lt;br /&gt;
has been exsist -&amp;gt; persisted
&lt;br /&gt;
restrict -&amp;gt; intervention to regulate
&lt;br /&gt;
elaborate on -&amp;gt; delve into
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if some earn most of money, other become tortured form poverty as long as wealthy don’t distribute their portion of money. most people usually think we earn depending on how much we did but normal people don’t have enought opportunity to learn enough. they become poverty because simply don’t know any better. every people doing their best on their own way but metthew effect is getting worser. if someone don’t learn enough, they don’t even know why they can’t learn and they fight each other rather than advocate government to educate them more. so this situation is getting even harder to manage.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If some individuals earn the majority of the money, others are subjected to the torment of poverty, as long as the wealthy fail to distribute their share of wealth. Many people commonly believe that earnings are directly tied to the amount of effort exerted, but ordinary individuals often lack sufficient opportunities to acquire adequate knowledge. They find themselves in poverty simply because they lack awareness of better options. Each person strives to the best of their ability, but the Matthew Effect, wherein the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, worsens. When individuals do not receive adequate education, they remain unaware of the reasons behind their learning difficulties and end up fighting amongst themselves instead of advocating for increased government support in education. Consequently, this situation becomes increasingly challenging to manage.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;most -&amp;gt; majority
&lt;br /&gt;
tortured by -&amp;gt; subjected to the torment
&lt;br /&gt;
don’t -&amp;gt; fail

&lt;br /&gt;
harder -&amp;gt; increasingly challenging
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and also, if we just neglect the disparity between wealthy and poverty, this will eventually resulting in diminishing diversity of human species. if we lose variasity, we become subjective to desaster which aim to specific genetics like gene desease and also if wealthy doesn’t goes together with great personality, our lives becomming more and more bad.

And also, if we neglect the disparity between wealth and poverty, it will eventually result in the diminishing diversity of the human species. When we lose diversity, we become susceptible to disasters that target specific genetics, such as genetic diseases.

Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example to young people
&lt;br /&gt;
to what extent do you agree?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
today, young people usually see agressive news which don’t impose poeple to think deeply but stimulating the peripheral nerves. some argue that emphasizing the superpecial things like appearance and money rather then inner things such as personality resulting in detrimental effect on young people. i will elaborate on my opinion further in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today, young people are often exposed to aggressive news that fails to encourage deep thinking but rather stimulates their superficial senses. Some argue that the excessive emphasis on superficial aspects like appearance and wealth, rather than inner qualities such as personality, has a detrimental effect on young people. I will elaborate further on my opinion in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;peripheral nerves -&amp;gt; superficial senses
&lt;br /&gt;
superpecial things -&amp;gt; superficial aspects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
every human’s behavior is affected by rewards. that principle bring advertisement company and news to expose people success from superficial aspect rather than from deeply elaborating as most people wants to get the news which is superficial things. we don’t admit the success from ability and elaborate which phenomenon arise from difference of start point among us but that should not make us to prevent from elaborating.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every human’s behavior is influenced by rewards. This principle leads advertising companies and news outlets to highlight superficial aspects of people’s success rather than providing in-depth elaboration. This is because most people are interested in news that focuses on superficial matters. We often fail to acknowledge success based on one’s abilities and the effort put into it. However, we should not overlook success based on ability and depth, even though there may be differences in starting points among individuals. This should not discourage us from seeking and appreciating deeper understanding and elaboration.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our life is about reward. every people’s behavior is based on what they get from their behavior. reward is diverse in form such as money, love, or even knowledge. as long as advertisement company highlight success in superficial things, this will affect young people to think they can get high reward from superficial matters.

Our lives revolve around rewards. Every person’s behavior is driven by what they gain from their actions. Rewards appear in diverse forms, such as money, love, or even knowledge.

what is the most important thing to succeed in life?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
generally people believe successful in school should be prerequisite of successful in life. However there were always some who was not successful in school but in life. i will write my inference of the reason of this situation further in the following paragraph.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Generally, people believe that success in school is a prerequisite for success in life. However, there have always been individuals who were not successful in school but still managed to achieve success in life. In the following paragraph, I will provide my inference on the reasons behind this situation.

&lt;p&gt;the regular education of school is stands for keep the human species from unnesscerly excessive explore by providing guideline. but as time progresses, world’s gaining diversity resulting in making lots of way to live. as we can’t cover and guide every case by regular education there are occer some cases who success with their own way didn’t following the regular course.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The regular education system in schools aims to prevent unnecessary and excessive exploration by providing guidelines. However, as the world progresses, it becomes increasingly diverse, giving rise to various paths in life. Since the regular education system cannot cover and guide every individual case, there are instances where individuals find success by following their own unique paths, deviating from the conventional course.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now we can come up with one question about what is important to be successful. i believe the most important thing is becoming confident. since we live in different environment, we are getting our own strength in our life. every our behavior has personal significant in their pursuit of happiness moreover If someone focuses on one skill, we can identify the area in which they are optimized using the maximum principle of convex optimization theory. If you come across someone who is optimized in a particular area, you can ascertain their focus on one skill through the strong separation theorem of convex optimization theory. but we can only become extreme to one area through stop comparing ourselves with another because we can easily loose our confidence by that behavior.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, we can raise a question about what is important for success. I believe that the most crucial factor is developing confidence. As we live in diverse environments, we cultivate our own strengths in life. Each of our behaviors holds personal significance in our pursuit of happiness. Furthermore, If someone focuses on one skill, we can identify the area in which they are optimized using the maximum principle of convex optimization theory. If you come across someone who is optimized in a particular area, you can ascertain their focus on one skill through the strong separation theorem of convex optimization theory. However, we can only become truly exceptional in one area by refraining from comparing ourselves to others, as such comparisons can easily undermine our confidence.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the government should allocate more funding to teaching sciences rather than subjects in order for a country to develop and progress
&lt;br /&gt;
to what extent do you agree?
&lt;br /&gt;
A
&lt;br /&gt;
as the time progresses, the world is becomming globalize due to the advancement of transportation system and online platform. but most crucial factor behind all this change is improvement of techonology over time. some advocate goverment to fund more in techonology through weighting more in teaching in regular education. i will provide detailed explaination of my perspective on this matter further in the following paragraph.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As time progresses, the world is becoming more globalized due to advancements in transportation systems and online platforms. However, the most crucial factor driving these changes is the continuous improvement of technology. Some argue that the government should invest more in technology by giving it greater importance in regular education. In the following paragraph, I will provide a detailed explanation of my perspective on this matter.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;advancement of -&amp;gt; advancements in 
&lt;br /&gt;
factor behind -&amp;gt; factor driving
&lt;br /&gt;
improvement of techonology over time -&amp;gt; continuous improvement of technology
&lt;br /&gt;
weighting more in -&amp;gt; giving it greater importance
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even though every imporvement is due to techonological advancement, that doesn’t bring hapiness of human species. as difference between wealthy and poverty getting worse, persentage of homeless is rather getting more than before which phenomenon is occered from loophole of policy.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even though every improvement is due to technological advancement, that doesn’t necessarily bring happiness to the human species. As the difference between wealth and poverty worsens, the percentage of homelessness is increasing rather than decreasing, which is a phenomenon occurring due to policy loopholes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;getting worse -&amp;gt; worsen
&lt;br /&gt;
which phenomenon occered from-&amp;gt; which is a phenomenon occering due to
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;government’s excessive influence to some area is potentially problematic. for instance, in korea, government’s excessively support in medical science brings lots of medical accident because there are lots of people who wanna practice surgery even though they are not qualified or not interested in help people sincerely and even worse, government makes lots of loophole in the law in the medical field with the reason of assitance of medical field.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Government’s excessive influence in certain areas can pose potential problems. For instance, in Korea, the government’s excessive support in the field of medical science has resulted in numerous medical accidents. This is due to the presence of individuals who are eager to perform surgeries without proper qualifications or genuine dedication to helping people. Furthermore, the government’s creation of loopholes in medical laws, under the guise of assisting the medical field, exacerbates the situation.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;some -&amp;gt; certain
&lt;br /&gt;
imply -&amp;gt; pose
&lt;br /&gt;
lots of -&amp;gt; numerous
&lt;br /&gt;
interested in help sincerily -&amp;gt; genuine dedication
&lt;br /&gt;
with the reason of -&amp;gt; under the guise of, under the pretense of
&lt;br /&gt;
worsen -&amp;gt; exacerbates
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i believe the most important thing is, government have to assist people to crave out their own way through balance the investment on each field not invest excessively on the just few field as happiness is achieved through preventing metthew effect regardless of advancement of techonology.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So I believe the most important thing is that the government assists people in carving out their own path by balancing investments in each field, rather than investing excessively in just a few areas. Happiness is achieved through preventing the Matthew effect, regardless of technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;assist people to crave out -&amp;gt; assist people in craving out (people who are carving out)

respecting individual’s choice is important as every one’s choice has their own meaning in aspect of chasing the happiness. even though we have to keep that kinds of attitude, sometimes we have to compel some extent of guideline to prevent human species from falling in sub optimization because sometimes we choose difficult way because we purely don’t know any better. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Respecting individuals’ choices is crucial, as each person’s choice holds personal significance in their pursuit of happiness. However, there are instances where it becomes necessary to impose certain guidelines to prevent the human species from falling into sub-optimization, as sometimes we choose difficult paths simply because we lack better alternatives.

&lt;p&gt;computer science help us to relieve the problem which is like “falling in sub optimization” or “make hasty disition” by learning another people’s life through internet flatform like another regular subjects. in instance, ability associated with math enabling us to think more logically and sensible, literacy and computer science facilitate us to communicate.which is why regular education stands for us.

Computer science plays a vital role in addressing such challenges, as it allows us to learn from the lives of others through online platforms, much like any other regular subject. For example, proficiency in mathematics fosters logical and rational thinking, while literacy and computer science skills enhance communication abilities. These are the reasons why computer education is an essential component of a well-rounded education system.

A
&lt;br /&gt;
we sometimes can see the argument that says languages have only few origins.however, with the time progression, human species have gained the diversity in language to meet each other’s needs of expression which varies across the country. this development bring languages to be interwined with culture. someone argue we can’t learn another culture unless learning language. i will elaborate my perspective of view with this argument in the following paragraph further.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We sometimes encounter the argument that languages have only a few origins. However, as time has progressed, the human species has gained linguistic diversity to fulfill the varied needs of expression across different countries. This development has resulted in languages becoming intertwined with culture. Some argue that we cannot truly understand another culture without learning its language. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding this argument
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it can be difficult to learn another countries culture without learning their language because we can see their priority from way to talk. when their country is surrounded by sea, they are used to use the term about ship, fish. when their country is located in the north part of earth, they are used to use language about snow, blizzard. their language is probably developed to that way so as to express details about their important things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;revise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It can be difficult to understand another country’s culture without learning their language, as their language reveals their priorities and preferences. For instance, if a country is surrounded by sea, their language may incorporate terms specific to ships and fish. Similarly, if a country is located in the northern part of the Earth, their language may include words specific to snow and blizzards. These linguistic nuances are likely developed to express the important aspects of their environment and daily life
