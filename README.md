I created this blog to improve my life. 

I used to use Naver Blog, which is a popular blogging platform in South Korea. However, I realized that it limited my ability to connect with friends from around the world. 

With this new blog, I plan to share my studies, hobbies, and personal experiences. Hopefully, it can be a helpful resource for others who are studying similar topics. Additionally, I hope to use it as a portfolio to showcase my work. 

<br/>
And who knows, maybe it will even help me make new friends internationally. 

<br/>
thank you
