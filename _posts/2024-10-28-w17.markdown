there is debate about wether having a class by online have more advantage over having a class by offline. i examine the advantage and disadvantage of this argument and will further elaborate on my opinion in the following paragraph.

There is a debate concerning whether online classes offer more advantages than offline ones. I will examine the merits and drawbacks of this argument and will further elaborate on my opinion in the subsequent paragraphs.


to begin with, let us consider the merits of having offline class. they argue that there is something children can not learn through online class. they are not only can learn academical subject but also learn some humanity. For example, they can play traditional game together and as physical environment is susceptable to violence and easily hurt each other, they can learn how to respect each other.

To begin with, let us consider the merits of offline classes. Proponents argue that there are certain lessons that cannot be learned through online classes. Students are able to engage not only in academic subjects but also in lessons of humanity. For example, they can participate in traditional games together, and because the physical environment may expose them to potential conflicts, it provides opportunities to learn respect for one another.


for the opposite perspective, some people argue that online class is more effective than offline class. the main reason beings online class save the time for commute and easy to sulvillance the behavior. students need to wear the uniform to get the school and it takes around 1hour, so it totally takes about 2hours for commute every day. moreover there are no cctv in the school in some country, so it is hard to monitering student's behavior in the offline class.

From the opposite perspective, some individuals argue that online classes are more effective than offline classes. The primary reasons include the time saved on commuting and the ease of monitoring behavior. Students typically need to wear uniforms and spend about an hour traveling to school, which amounts to approximately two hours of commuting daily. Moreover, the absence of surveillance cameras in schools in some countries makes it challenging to monitor students' behavior in offline classes.



i'm partially agree with that online class is more advantaged than face to face class. it can be true that students can learn some extent of cooperation and socializing while clowning around together. but if schools are lake of control over students and irresponsible, that brings the school violence problem and demaging the socialization rather than improvement.

I partially agree that online classes offer more advantages than face-to-face classes. It is true that students can learn some degree of cooperation and socialization while engaging in playful activities together. However, if schools lack control over students and are irresponsible, this can lead to issues such as school violence, ultimately damaging socialization rather than enhancing it.
