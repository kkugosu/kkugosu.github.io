Some people believe that art should be an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

<br/>
humans subconciousness has been revealed in the various ways. we make music, we dream, we draw art. 
among them, art has been strong tools for humans to express their unconciousness. when we don't have any structured logic like language, we start to express our emotion by art.
so our language was initially picture and it is simplified over time.
which might allow as to deduce humans language were somehow derived from the art. however, as times flows, art is become not essentional way to live. we can express our knowledge by math or science 
not from art or music. but some people still think art is essentional. i will elaborate my perspective to the following paragraph.

after we start to formulate our logic, we were try to start thinking everything in a logical way. 
rather than taking tham emotionally. we made computer and make everything faster and art seems meaningless
since they don't have any strict structure. which can't make money immediately.

but i'm partially agree with the opinion that art should be essential. whenever we discover something new, as we need creative thinking, 
and we need hunch about the area where no one have expored before 
and we can increase our creative thinking by art.

Art has always been a vital aspect of human expression and communication. While some argue that art is an essential subject for children in school, 
others view it as an unnecessary diversion. This essay will explore both perspectives before presenting my viewpoint.

Art, transcending mere aesthetics, taps into the human subconscious in profound ways through music, dreams, and visual expression. 
Historically, art served as humanity's earliest form of language, with pictorial representations evolving into the complex languages we use today. 
This deep rooted connection to art suggests its fundamental role in cognitive and emotional development. In educational settings, 
engaging with art can foster creativity and critical thinking, skills indispensable in an increasingly complex world.

However, some critics argue that in the modern era, art has lost its practical value. 
With the advent of technology and science, avenues like mathematics and engineering offer more definitive benefits in terms of career prospects and economic contributions. 
They contend that art, lacking structure and immediate financial benefits, does not merit a core place in the school curriculum, 
which should focus on subjects that directly enhance students' employability and productivity.

I partially agree that art should remain a staple in education. 
Artistic activities are not just about creating; they are also about problem solving and innovating. For instance, 
when students engage in artistic endeavors, they develop a knack for creative thinking and gain insights into areas 
that are yet unexplored by conventional disciplines. This blend of creativity and analytical thinking is crucial when facing new challenges or venturing into novel research fields.

In conclusion, while the pragmatic value of art may seem diminished in the face of technological advancements, 
its intrinsic benefits particularly in fostering innovative minds cannot be overlooked. Therefore, I believe that art should maintain 
its place as an essential subject in schools, complementing the logical rigor of science and mathematics with its unique contributions to human insight and creativity.
