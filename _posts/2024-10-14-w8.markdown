Many people believe that when choosing a job, job satisfaction is more important than the size of the salary. 
Discuss what you think about this view. Provide your opinion based on your own experience or observations, 
and explain whether you think this belief is common or if it is a personal view.


there is argument between two groups, regarding where we have to weight for the job. one argue that job is only for money and other argue that job itself is also life
and we need to find enjoy in the job. i will further elaborate my opinion in the following paragraph.


There is a debate between two groups regarding the purpose of a job. One group argues that a job is merely a means to earn money, 
while the other contends that a job is also an integral part of life and that one should find enjoyment in it. 
I will further elaborate on my opinion in the following paragraph.


from the perspective of first group, job is primary exist for the flow of currency. when we do something for another people, they give us money for the compensation. 
for example, when we work at the convenience store, we are help people to buy things more easily and we got the money from the company. company buy stuff from the subcontractor
and give them money. also when we work at the coffee shop, we make coffee for the custom and get money from the store menager. so their standpoint of the word is mainly flow the money
and they think, if we earn lots of money from the job, our job inheritly harbor higher value than the job which is not.


From the perspective of the first group, a job primarily exists to facilitate the flow of currency. When we perform tasks for others, 
they compensate us with money. For example, when we work at a convenience store, we assist customers in making purchases more easily, and in return, 
we receive payment from the company. The company, in turn, purchases goods from subcontractors and compensates them. Similarly, when working at a coffee shop, 
we prepare coffee for customers and receive payment from the store manager. Thus, their viewpoint is predominantly focused on the flow of money. They believe that if a job yields substantial income, 
it inherently possesses greater value than one that does not.



However, from the perspective of the opposite viewpoint, the satisfaction is most important when we find the job. every job has their own meaning and every people has their own strength. for example, 
some people is good at language which nessiciate lots of memory capacity when it comes to learning and some people is good at mathmetics which needs lots of inductive contemplation but don't need lots of memory.
the job related to the mathmethic and science can yields higher income and the job related to the language cannot do that but this doesn't means language associated job is useless. sometimes we can visit to the area 
doesn't support the internet and we need the help.

However, from the perspective of the opposing viewpoint, satisfaction is paramount when seeking a job. Every job holds its unique significance, and each individual possesses their own strengths. 
For instance, some people excel in languages, which require substantial memory capacity for learning, while others are proficient in mathematics, which demands extensive inductive reasoning but not necessarily a great deal of memory. 
Jobs related to mathematics and science may yield higher incomes, whereas those related to languages might not, but this does not mean that language-associated jobs are valueless. 
Sometimes, we may visit areas without internet support and require assistance.



Im personally agree with the side arguing that satisfaction of job is most important part when we find the job. maybe it is true that certain job has low value than other job but some jobs are even absolutely irreplaceable by science 
which should deal with emotional aspect such as empathy. and it is also true that every people have their own strengh.
and sometimes their interest also follow their expertization so if they are position in the right place, their performance will be higher than wrong place.

I personally agree with the perspective that the satisfaction derived from a job is the most important aspect when seeking employment. 
It may be true that certain jobs are valued less than others, but some roles, particularly those dealing with emotional aspects such as empathy, are absolutely irreplaceable by science. 
It is also true that every individual possesses their own strengths. Sometimes, their interests align with their expertise, so if they are positioned correctly, 
their performance will be superior to that in a less suitable placement.
