even though are reasonable enough to descern meaningful information, the problem of providing distorted or unnecessary information is that affect our furture learning direction. for example, when we get to know about new fast food, our knowledge fool of food extended on the direction of fast food which incur increasing probability for us to choose fast food. when we come to reach the news of gun murder in america, we easily think there are lots of gun accident eventhough that is not occer often. this also happened in fake news, which bring our attention and make us to investigate about it also resulting our knowledge to extend to that area, same effect as provided unnescessary information.

Although we are capable of discerning meaningful content, distorted or unnecessary information can still influence our future learning path. For example, when we come across news about a new fast-food chain, our exposure to fast food increases, leading to a higher likelihood of choosing it. Similarly, when we encounter reports of gun violence in America, we may mistakenly assume that such incidents occur frequently, despite their infrequent nature. This also applies to fake news, which grabs our attention, prompts further investigation, and expands our knowledge in areas that may not hold significant value, ultimately having the same effect as providing unnecessary information.

The way to manage attendants is recommended to vary depending on the characteristics of each department. I believe one of the most prominent personality traits in human beings is being active. Active individuals tend to follow their curiosity, leading to improved intelligence compared to others, as well as greater independence because they challenge traditional practices by asking questions. When active individuals are placed in departments that require continuous change and experimentation, they thrive in such environments. However, if they are placed in departments that do not offer such opportunities, they may experience significant stress. Wearing a costume can create a sense of unity and conformity, but it can also constrain divergent thinking, limiting the possibility of questioning and stifling creativity

Simply incarcerating individuals and increasing police presence on the streets does not solve the root problem; it is cost-effective but not a comprehensive solution. The key to eliminating crime lies in education. We have a responsibility to guide individuals in the right direction and we can achieve this by incentivizing learning, such as providing financial rewards when we observe significant progress in their knowledge acquisition.

some attempt to revert to traditional healthcare method contrast to modern medical technology, there is some contraversary in healthcare system between existing approach and new approach. even though both methods ,historically, are enhanced through experimental results, traditional method is usually researched about correlation of organs which seems not correlated each other so their methods are related to neuro system. modern method is usually focus on directly alleviate the abnormal symtom of that organ and start searching pheriperal area which is known as correlated with that organ with aid of modern analysis techonology. so most problem can be solved with modern technology but when we encounter unprecedented problem, there is presence of probability that traditional method will work.

There are some attempts to revert to traditional healthcare methods, which contrasts with modern medical technology. This has created some controversy within the healthcare system, as both approaches have historically been enhanced through experimental results. Traditional methods often involve researching the correlation of organs that may not seem directly related, focusing on the neuro system. On the other hand, modern methods concentrate on directly alleviating abnormal symptoms of specific organs and utilize modern analysis technology to explore peripheral areas known to be correlated with those organs.
While modern technology can address most problems, when faced with unprecedented issues, there is a possibility that traditional methods could prove effective. This highlights the ongoing debate between the existing and new approaches in healthcare.
