Sports have plenty of beneficial aspects. We can improve our socialization skills by communicating with each other in multiplayer sports. We can relieve stress and enhance our health by engaging in physical activities. Additionally, even in e-sports, which do not require stamina, we can improve our motor skills. However, I believe the most rewarding aspect of sports is the experience itself. As our equipment continues to advance over time, we can explore and participate in various activities that were previously inaccessible. Nowadays, modernized sports allow us to learn a wide range of skills, enabling us to enhance our ability to tackle different problems using different approaches.

According to one investigation conducted at california states of US on twenty generation, the decreased by sports are decreasing as their proficiency increasing. For example, the people dead rate while scuba diving is totally 0.01% but 80% of that portion was occupied by people who's experience of diving is less than 50times even though average experience time of diving was 200times. the lesson we can learn with this experience is dangerous sports itself doesn't affect the possibility of critical injury but insufficient understanding of sports itself.

According to an investigation conducted in California, United States, spanning twenty generations, the occurrence of accidents in sports is decreasing as proficiency levels increase. For instance, the fatality rate while scuba diving is only 0.01%. However, 80% of these incidents involve individuals with less than 50 diving experiences, despite the average diving experience being 200 times. The lesson we can learn from this is that the inherent danger in sports does not necessarily determine the likelihood of critical injuries; rather, it is often attributed to a lack of understanding and knowledge about the sport itself

In summary, what i would like to state is the riskness of sports are not based on defficulty but understanding of that sports. moreover, since benefit of experiencing new sports are invaluable we can't restrict the range of available sports. In conclution, I think we have to be care of education of security than just ban the sports.

In summary, what I would like to emphasize is that the level of risk in sports is not solely determined by their difficulty but rather by our understanding of those sports. Furthermore, considering the invaluable benefits of experiencing new sports, we should not restrict the range of available activities. In conclusion, I believe it is essential to prioritize education on safety measures rather than simply banning certain sports.
