Hmm, I’m thinking of jotting down my thoughts whenever I have time.

Life is unpredictable—you never know when it might suddenly end.

It feels too overwhelming to keep everything to myself, so I feel like I should leave my thoughts somewhere.

What I’m writing now is about the time before I started elementary school.

I was born in 1994 and entered elementary school in 2000 at the age of 7, as an early '94 baby.

To be honest, I don’t remember much from back then. There was a kid living next door who was a year younger than me—was their name Hyunjae?

They were between me and my younger sibling, who’s two years younger than me. The three of us seemed to have had a really happy time together.

At that time, my parents were... well, how should I put it? My father was a junior college graduate, and my mother was a high school graduate. 
They were both getting older, but no one wanted to date them, so they ended up having an arranged marriage.
