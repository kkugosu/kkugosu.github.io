Cultures around the world possess their own unique colors, often expressed through diverse forms of art such as wall engravings, music, dance, and more. However, as time progresses, people's lives have become increasingly devoid of leisure, resulting in a diminished interest in art that does not directly impact their daily lives. In the following paragraphs, I will explain my perspective on the reasons behind this phenomenon and propose potential solutions for the future.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
> as times going on -> as time progresses + have pp
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The main reason of people to getting devoid of leasure is their lives are becomming hard to fulfill even their basic needs. which phenomenon arised from unsensible policy which are only made for wealthy people, resulting in increasing disparity between poverty and wealthy. The issue is wealthy occupy only small portion of all population and else occupy the most part of it. so this phenomenon leads to conclution of people to prioritize other one than art.

The main reason people are becoming devoid of leisure is the increasing difficulty in fulfilling their basic needs. This phenomenon arises from unjust policies that predominantly benefit the wealthy, consequently widening the gap between poverty and wealth. The issue lies in the fact that a smaller and smaller portion of the population possesses wealth, while more and more people face economic challenges over time. As a result, people are inclined to prioritize other aspects of life over art.
<br/>
> becoming hard to -> increasing difficulty in
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
> increasing disparity -> widening
<br/>

<br/>
> priortize other one than art -> priortize other aspects of life over art

i believe we cannot solve this problem by just increasing the quality of art because the criteria of art also changing while quality of art increase. i think the most sensible solution in this situation is making people to be relized of this phenomen and making sound to government to increasing tex for just wealthy who is top earning of the world. regardless of their power, we can achieve the happy world if we don't fight next person and aim to common end.

I believe we cannot solve this problem by simply increasing the quality of art because the criteria for art also change as the quality of art improves. I think the most sensible solution in this situation is to raise people's awareness of this phenomenon and advocate for the government to increase taxes for the wealthy, who are the top earners in the world. Regardless of their power, we can achieve a happier world if we refrain from fighting against one another and strive towards a common goal.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
> don't -> refrain from
<br/>
> fight next person -> fighting against one another
<br/>
> aim to -> strive towards

<br/>
In conclution, the phenomenon people to increasingly devoid art arises from disparity of wealth and poverty, not from innate problem of art or from people's low comprehensive in terms of art. we can solve this problem by gathering together and advocate government to texing higher on the wealthy.

<br/>
In conclusion, the phenomenon of people becoming increasingly deprived of art arises from the disparity between wealth and poverty, rather than from an inherent problem with art or from people's lack of understanding of art. We can address this issue by coming together and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy from the government.
