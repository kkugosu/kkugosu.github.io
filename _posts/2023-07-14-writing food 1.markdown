Q
<br/>
with a growing world population one of the most pressing issues is that of feeding such a large number of people. some people think that gm foods offer a viable solution to this problem to what extent do you agree
<br/>
A
<br/>
<br/>
As population over the world increase, Some argue that genetic modified foods will be good alternative of real food to sort out depletion of food problem. In the following paragraph, i will elaborate on my perspective regarding this argument.

sort out -> address

The development of gene over the time was based on "proper survive" principle which means they should provide good nutrition for animal to survive and also they should be optimized to prospering. But if they don't have to worry about breed, there is no point to modify their behavior to prospering by decreasing efficiency of providing nutrition. so there are still many ways to make plant improve in our favor without any side effect. Additionally,According to the investigation conducted in California, United States, on the residents about cancer rate between who continue to consuming genetic modified food regularly and who didn't, surprisingly the ratio of occurence of cancer in formar group was rather more lower than later group by 0.0003%. even though they didn't account for another varience to rule out such as wealthyness, gender, workplace, at least we don't have any proper reason to deduce GM food are harm for our health.

The development of genes over time has been based on the principle of 'proper survival,' which means they should provide good nutrition for animals to survive and optimize their chances of prospering. However, if there is no concern about breeding, there is no point in modifying their behavior to prioritize prospering at the expense of decreased nutritional efficiency. Therefore, there are still many ways to improve plants in our favor without any adverse side effects. Additionally, according to an investigation conducted in California, United States, comparing the cancer rates between residents who regularly consume genetically modified food and those who don't, the occurrence of cancer in the former group was surprisingly lower by 0.0003% compared to the latter group. Although this study did not account for other variables such as wealth, gender, or workplace, it provides no substantial reason to deduce that GM foods are harmful to our health.

However, we have to think about if GM foods are only one solution to takle with deplation of food problem. Some people just grown their own plant or animal to eat so it doesn't seems make sense that food depletion can be problem. i think the root of problem is inconsistent density of population which brings city side people to feel the price of food as expensive which is result of additional transportation and maintainence fee. so if we just make food more, this can simply suffocate local farmar without solving root problem.
<br/>
However, we must consider whether GM foods are the only solution to tackle the issue of food depletion. Some people choose to grow their own plants or raise animals for consumption, making the concept of food depletion seem less relevant. I believe the root problem lies in the uneven distribution of population density, which leads urban dwellers to perceive food prices as expensive due to additional transportation and maintenance costs. Simply increasing food production could potentially suffocate local farmers without addressing the underlying problem."
<br/>
if -> whether
inconsistent -> uneven
root problem -> underlying problem
<br/>
<br/>
In summary, we can conclude GM is good way to make food because development process of food is not optimized to good for human so it can be improved more without any side effect. However the problem with the food can be not necessairy came from food depletation so it is possible that we cannot solve that problem by making more food easily.
<br/>
<br/>
In summary, we can conclude that genetic modification is a good approach to improving food production as the development process of food is not optimized solely for human benefit. It can be further improved without significant side effects. However, it is important to note that the problem with food may not necessarily arise solely from food depletion. Therefore, simply increasing food production may not be the easy solution to address the underlying problem.
