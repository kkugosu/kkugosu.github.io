Q
<br/>
<br/>
As computer translate quickly and accurately, learning fireign languages is a waste of time?
<br/>
to what extend do you agree or disagree
<br/>
<br/>
A
<br/>
throughout human's history, we struggle to learn another language to communicate with another country to fulfill each other's needs. as computer science have grown up especially artificial intelligence, computer start learning multiple language together resulting in becoming capable of translating. today, some people even say our need to learn foreign language becomming deminishing. i'm not agree with them and will explain the reason in the following paragraph further.

<br/>
Throughout human history, we have strived to learn different languages in order to communicate with people from other countries and fulfill each other's needs. With the advancement of computer science, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, computers have started to learn multiple languages simultaneously, enabling them to perform translation tasks. Today, some people argue that our need to learn foreign languages is diminishing. However, I disagree with this perspective and will further explain the reasons in the following paragraph.
<br/>
> human's history -> human history
<br/>
> struggle -> strive (struggle = solve difficulty, strive = for goal)
<br/>
> to -> in order to
<br/>
> learn another language -> learn different languages
<br/>
> communicate with country -> communicate people in another country
<br/>
> as~ growing up -> with advancement
<br/>
> especially ai -> particularilly in the fielf of ai
<br/>
> start ing -> have started to
<br/>
> at the same time -> simultaneously
<br/>
> resulting in becomeing -> enabling them to perform
<br/>
> say -> argue
<br/>
> don't agree with them -> disagree with this perspective
<br/>

Eventhough languages came from just few common origin, as Language is used as one of means of life of human, it is improved over the time according to human needs. today's language varies depend on the country and they also reflect their culture. we can understand another's culture by learning language not only make us to commmunicate easily.

Even though languages have common origins, they have evolved over time to meet the diverse needs of human life. Language serves as a fundamental tool for communication and has been shaped by different countries and cultures. By learning a language, we not only gain the ability to communicate more easily but also develop a deeper understanding of another culture.

<br/>

<br/>
> varies depend on country -> shaped by different countries
<br/>
> make us communicate easily -> gain ability to communicate easily
<br/>
> can understand -> develop deeper understanding

<br/>

and also there is big problem when we don't learn language anymore and fully resort at translater. we can't supervise whether ai translate language properly or not which will arise or incurring misunderstanding across the country.

<br/>
And also, there is a significant problem when we no longer learn languages and solely rely on translators. We are unable to supervise whether AI translates languages accurately, which can lead to misunderstandings across countries.
<br/>
> big -> significant
<br/>
> don't anymore -> no longer
<br/>
> fully -> solely
<br/>
> can't -> unable
<br/>
> properly -> accurately
<br/>

in conclution, we have necessairly to learn foreign language because of disadvantages occered from not learning them and advantages which are unable to be accomplished from simply using translater.

<br/>
In conclusion, it is necessary for us to learn foreign languages due to the disadvantages that arise from not learning them and the advantages that cannot be achieved by simply relying on translators.
