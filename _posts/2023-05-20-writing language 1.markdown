<br/>
Throughout human history, we have strived to learn different languages in order to communicate with people from other countries and fulfill each other's needs. With the advancement of computer science, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, computers have started to learn multiple languages simultaneously, enabling them to perform translation tasks. Today, some people argue that our need to learn foreign languages is diminishing. However, I disagree with this perspective and will further explain the reasons in the following paragraph.
