The diagram outlines the process of olive oil production, which can be categorized into three distinct stages: 
initial harvesting and preparation, oil extraction, and finally, storage for future use.

The process commences with olives being harvested from trees and placed in a collection vat. 
Following this, the olives are de-leafed and washed with water before being transferred to an olive mill, where they are crushed into a paste. 
The resulting olive paste is then processed in a malaxer at a temperature not exceeding 27��C. After this, the paste undergoes centrifugal pressing, which yields virgin olive oil. 
Subsequently, the oil either goes through a separation process, during which waste water is removed, or is decanted, filtering out solids and water. 
Regardless of the separation method used, the final products are stored in a tank to complete the process as outlined in the diagram.


The diagram outlines the steps involved in producing smoked fish. From an overall perspective, it is clear that the process can be categorized into three primary stages: 
the initial catching and transportation of the fish, followed by storage and processing, and finally, further storage and transportation to retail fish shops.

The process begins with the fish being caught in nets and transported by boat to a port. Once at the port, the fish are frozen before being thawed in fresh water. 
In the next stage, the fish are sliced open and immersed in a saltwater solution that contains a small amount of yellow coloring. 
Following this, the fish undergo the actual smoking process. Once smoked, the fish are packed into boxes and frozen at a temperature of zero degrees Celsius in larger containers. 
The final step involves grouping the fish into cold storage bins before they are distributed by truck to retail shops for sale to consumers.




The diagram above outlines the production process of both pu'erh raw and ripe tea. From a broad perspective, it is evident that the process consists of three primary stages: 
the initial deactivation and drying of the leaves, followed by either aging or fermentation, and concluding with storage for raw tea or compression for ripe tea.

The process begins similarly for both tea varieties, with the leaves being fried in pans to deactivate specific enzymes. After this, the leaves are rolled and dried under the sun. 
At the subsequent stage, the processes diverge. For ripe tea, the loose raw tea undergoes fermentation with mold before being compressed to form the final product. On the other hand, 
in the production of raw tea, the leaves are compressed first and then aged. Once the aging process is complete, the pu'erh raw tea is ready for consumption.



The diagram delineates the manufacturing process of leather goods intended for retail sale. An overview reveals that this entirely artificial procedure consists of three primary phases: the initial transport of raw materials to the manufacturing facility, the preparation and processing of these materials, and, finally, the production of consumer goods.

Initially, the leather skins, derived from various animals, are dried. Following this step, they are transported by truck to a factory, where they undergo a washing process using water and lime. The skins are subsequently immersed in additional lime for a specified duration before being processed through a machine equipped with large rollers to flatten them.



The document outlines the procedures for manufacturing cement and subsequently using it to produce concrete. The process commences with the initial blending and chemical alteration of clay and limestone, culminating in the packaging of the final cement product, which is then utilized as a component in concrete production.

Initially, limestone and clay are gathered and pulverized into a fine powder. This powder is subsequently placed into a cylindrical mixer. The mixture undergoes transformation in a rotating heater, after which it is pulverized a second time and encapsulated in bags as finished cement.
To create concrete, cement is amalgamated with water, sand, and gravel in a concrete mixer. The specific proportions of the ingredients are 15% cement, 10% water, 25% sand, and 50% gravel, which consists of small stones.
