The diagram outlines the process of olive oil production, which can be categorized into three distinct stages: 
initial harvesting and preparation, oil extraction, and finally, storage for future use.

The process commences with olives being harvested from trees and placed in a collection vat. 
Following this, the olives are de-leafed and washed with water before being transferred to an olive mill, where they are crushed into a paste. 
The resulting olive paste is then processed in a malaxer at a temperature not exceeding 27¡ÆC. After this, the paste undergoes centrifugal pressing, which yields virgin olive oil. 
Subsequently, the oil either goes through a separation process, during which waste water is removed, or is decanted, filtering out solids and water. 
Regardless of the separation method used, the final products are stored in a tank to complete the process as outlined in the diagram.


The diagram outlines the steps involved in producing smoked fish. From an overall perspective, it is clear that the process can be categorized into three primary stages: 
the initial catching and transportation of the fish, followed by storage and processing, and finally, further storage and transportation to retail fish shops.

The process begins with the fish being caught in nets and transported by boat to a port. Once at the port, the fish are frozen before being thawed in fresh water. 
In the next stage, the fish are sliced open and immersed in a saltwater solution that contains a small amount of yellow coloring. 
Following this, the fish undergo the actual smoking process. Once smoked, the fish are packed into boxes and frozen at a temperature of zero degrees Celsius in larger containers. 
The final step involves grouping the fish into cold storage bins before they are distributed by truck to retail shops for sale to consumers.




The diagram above outlines the production process of both pu'erh raw and ripe tea. From a broad perspective, it is evident that the process consists of three primary stages: 
the initial deactivation and drying of the leaves, followed by either aging or fermentation, and concluding with storage for raw tea or compression for ripe tea.

The process begins similarly for both tea varieties, with the leaves being fried in pans to deactivate specific enzymes. After this, the leaves are rolled and dried under the sun. 
At the subsequent stage, the processes diverge. For ripe tea, the loose raw tea undergoes fermentation with mold before being compressed to form the final product. On the other hand, 
in the production of raw tea, the leaves are compressed first and then aged. Once the aging process is complete, the pu'erh raw tea is ready for consumption.




The maps above depict the current layout of Norbiton and the proposed future developments. 
From a broad perspective, it is evident that the town is set to transition from an industrial focus to a more residential one, with the addition of housing, educational, commercial, and medical facilities. 
This development will primarily take place in the western and northern parts of Norbiton, leaving only a small section of farmland untouched.

At present, the town features a central roundabout, surrounded by factories, and a road that runs from west to east through Norbiton. 
In the future, while the roundabout will remain, the surrounding factories will be replaced by shops. 
A new residential area will line a road to the northwest, and a hospital will be constructed to the southeast. 
Additionally, the original road leading east will be flanked by housing on both sides, with a large playground to the north and a school at the town's eastern boundary. 
Beyond the town center, a smaller roundabout will be introduced to the south, bisecting an existing street. 
In the north, a bridge will be constructed over the river, and a portion of the farmland will give way to housing, although the area to the east will remain unchanged.




The map illustrates the transformations that took place in the town of Willington during the years 1780, 1860, and 2000. 
From a broad perspective, it is evident that the town shifted towards a more residential and commercial character, with the introduction of new homes, roads, a bridge, shops, and recreational facilities, 
while natural areas such as forests and farmlands were diminished. Notably, the river remained unchanged throughout this period.

In 1780, Willington was home to only 100 residences, and large portions of land to the east and south were covered by farms and woods. 
The river flowed from north to south, a geographical feature that persisted unchanged through 2000. By 1860, 
some of the farms and wooded areas had been cleared to make way for a road extending from the river to a residential area in the northeast, 
which had grown to 200 homes. Additionally, a bridge was constructed over the river. By 2000, the number of homes had increased to 500, and all of the farmland and forest had been removed. 
This allowed for the development of two schools, three sports fields, and a series of shops along the southern bank of the river. 
A large lake was also added to the southern end of the river, marking the final significant alteration.



The floorplan illustrates the transformation of a building from 1958 to the present day. From a comprehensive viewpoint, it is evident that the building has served both commercial and residential functions, 
with the kitchen being the only area that has remained unchanged. Currently, the flower shop features a more open layout compared to when the building was an apartment and office.

In 1958, the building functioned as an office, with a meeting room occupying the top left corner of the floorplan, and an assistant¡¯s and secretary¡¯s office located beneath it. 
A toilet was positioned in the bottom left corner. By 1985, the meeting room had been expanded and converted into a living room, 
while a large bathroom and shower replaced the previous offices and toilet. The florist shop now features a gift card room in the top left corner, with a large open space for flowers and a play area situated in the bottom left. 
On the right side of the building, the kitchen in the top corner has remained consistent across all versions of the floorplan. In contrast, the manager's office and reception area, formerly used for bedrooms in the apartment, 
have been repurposed as an office and additional flower display space in the current layout.
