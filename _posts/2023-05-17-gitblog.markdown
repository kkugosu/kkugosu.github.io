# create
first you should install homebrew
and if you type ruby -v, it will display 2.6.8
i recommand you to download 2.7.8 because jekyll need >2.7 and there are often many issues after big update. as 2.7.8 is just before version 3.0.0, it provides a more stable option.

homebrew always download the lastest version which is unstable. by RBM, you can install ruby 2.7.8. i don't recommand downloading rbenv due to some tricky issues with it in this situation.
