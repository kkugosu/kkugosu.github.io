## create
First you should install homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
If you type ruby -v in your own terminal, it will display 2.6.8.
<br/>
<br/>
I recommand you to download 2.7.8 because jekyll need >2.7 and there are often many issues after big update. as 2.7.8 is just before version 3.0.0, it provides a more stable option.
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew always download the lastest version which is unstable. by RBM, you can install ruby 2.7.8. i don't recommand downloading rbenv due to some tricky issues with it in this situation.
<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, you should clone a theme from here http://jekyllthemes.org
and type following command in the terminal within the folder where you downloaded theme.
```ruby
bundler install

gem install jekyll bundler
```

Then you can see the basic theme running on your local server.
<br/>
## maintain
<br/>
To put it simply, you can make your own blog by just typing following command in your terminal after modify your files.
<br/>
```ruby
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
you can modify your 
<br/>
> _posts
<br/>
> _includes (arrange section on your own homepage)
<br/>
> README.md (introduction of homepage)
<br/>
> _config.yml (basic information)
<br/>

It is meaningless to modify _site as it is included in gitignore.
<br/>
Because it will be changed each time by running the command "bundle exec jekyll serve".
