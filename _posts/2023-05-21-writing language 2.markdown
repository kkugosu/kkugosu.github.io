Q
<br/>
scientist predict that all people will choose to take the same global language in the future
<br/>
do you think this is a positive or negative development?
<br/>
A
<br/>
even though languages are developed from common origins, they have been shaped by different countries in order to meet human needs. since england conquar the substantial numbers of countries, making them as colony under control, huge number of countries have been using english as mother toung. in contemporary world, this thing at that time resulting in making english as global language around the world. some sientists argue that all people will use english eventually and i will explain my perspective in the following paragraph further.

Even though languages have common origins, they have been shaped by different countries to meet human needs. Due to England's conquest of numerous countries and their colonization, a significant number of nations have adopted English as their mother tongue. In the contemporary world, this historical development has led to English becoming a global language. Some scientists argue that eventually, everyone will use English. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding this viewpoint.
<br/>
> developed from common origins -> have common origins
<br/>
> substantial number of -> numerous
<br/>
> have been using ~ as mother toung -> adopted ~ as their mother toung
<br/>
> this thing at that time -> historical development
<br/>
> explain -> elaborate on
<br/>
> about this -> regarding this viewpoint
<br/>

using same language as mother toung around the world can make us to communicate more easily which enabling us to enhance techonology more fastely. however this can be problem since that development doesn't necessarily resulting in language becomming optimized to our needs to expression. if we loose variety by choosing one language, when are in situation which we needs of express something which can't accomplished by english, we have no way to express that due to eradicate another languages. this phenomenon is called model collapse in ai terms.

Using the same language as a mother tongue around the world can make communication easier, enabling faster technological advancements. However, this can also be problematic as such development does not necessarily lead to the language becoming optimized for our expressive needs. If we lose linguistic diversity by adopting a single language, we may find ourselves in situations where we need to express something that cannot be adequately conveyed in English. In such cases, we would have no means to express those ideas because we have already eradicated other languages. This phenomenon is referred to as "model collapse" in AI terms.
