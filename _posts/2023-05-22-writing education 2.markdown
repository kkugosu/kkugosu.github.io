The world is becoming increasingly globalized, and this is evident not only in the advancement of transportation systems but also in the growing significance of online platforms that facilitate the exchange of information. Some argue that computer education should be included in the regular education system in response to this trend. In the following paragraph, I will provide a detailed explanation of my perspective on this matter.

respecting individual's choice is important as every one's choice has their own meaning in aspect of chasing the happiness. even though we have to keep that kinds of attitude, sometimes we have to compel some extent of guideline to prevent human species from falling in sub optimization because sometimes we choose difficult way because we purely don't know any better.

Respecting individuals' choices is crucial, as each person's choice holds personal significance in their pursuit of happiness. However, there are instances where it becomes necessary to impose certain guidelines to prevent the human species from falling into sub-optimization, as sometimes we choose difficult paths simply because we lack better alternatives.

computer science help us to relieve the problem which is like "falling in sub optimization" or "make hasty disition" by learning another people's life through internet flatform like another regular subjects. in instance, ability associated with math enabling us to think more logically and sensible, literacy and computer science facilitate us to communicate.which is why regular education stands for us.

Computer science plays a vital role in addressing such challenges, as it allows us to learn from the lives of others through online platforms, much like any other regular subject. For example, proficiency in mathematics fosters logical and rational thinking, while literacy and computer science skills enhance communication abilities. These are the reasons why computer education is an essential component of a well-rounded education system.
