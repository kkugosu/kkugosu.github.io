<br/>
what is the most important thing to succeed in life?
<br/>

Generally, people believe that success in school is a prerequisite for success in life. However, there have always been individuals who were not successful in school but still managed to achieve success in life. In the following paragraph, I will provide my inference on the reasons behind this situation.
<br/>
> prerequisite of -> prerequisite for
<br/>
> were always -> have always been
<br/>
> write my inference of -> provide my inference on
<br/>
> reason of this situation -> reason behind this situation

the regular education of school is stands for keep the human species from unnesscerly excessive explore by providing guideline. but as time progresses, world's gaining diversity resulting in making lots of way to live. as we can't cover and guide every case by regular education there are occer some cases who success with their own way didn't following the regular course.

The regular education system in schools aims to prevent unnecessary and excessive exploration by providing guidelines. However, as the world progresses, it becomes increasingly diverse, giving rise to various paths in life. Since the regular education system cannot cover and guide every individual case, there are instances where individuals find success by following their own unique paths, deviating from the conventional course.

now we can come up with one question about what is important to be successful. i believe the most important thing is becoming confident. since we live in different environment, we are getting our own strength in our life. every our behavior has personal significant in their pursuit of happiness moreover If someone focuses on one skill, we can identify the area in which they are optimized using the maximum principle of convex optimization theory. If you come across someone who is optimized in a particular area, you can ascertain their focus on one skill through the strong separation theorem of convex optimization theory. but we can only become extreme to one area through stop comparing ourselves with another because we can easily loose our confidence by that behavior.

Now, we can raise a question about what is important for success. I believe that the most crucial factor is developing confidence. As we live in diverse environments, we cultivate our own strengths in life. Each of our behaviors holds personal significance in our pursuit of happiness. Furthermore, If someone focuses on one skill, we can identify the area in which they are optimized using the maximum principle of convex optimization theory. If you come across someone who is optimized in a particular area, you can ascertain their focus on one skill through the strong separation theorem of convex optimization theory. However, we can only become truly exceptional in one area by refraining from comparing ourselves to others, as such comparisons can easily undermine our confidence.
