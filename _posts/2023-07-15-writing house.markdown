Q
<br/>
Many countries are experiencing population growth and need more homes
<br/>
A
<br/>
<br/>
With prosperation of mankind over the world, The population have increased over time. As our space to live limited, we start try to decide whether to build house in country side or city side. in the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding discussion of advantage and disadvantage to choose one of each side.

With the prosperity of mankind worldwide, the population has steadily increased over time. As available living space becomes limited, we are faced with the decision of whether to build houses in the countryside or in urban areas. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding the advantages and disadvantages of choosing either side
<br/>
<br/>
prosperation -> prosperity
over the world -> worldwide
try to decide -> faced with decision
one of each side -> either side
<br/>
<br/>
As we have lots of workplace in the cityside, the price of house and rent fee at the city side is higher than country side. according to the principle of law of supply and demand,
If we build lots of house at the cityside, we can expect the price of house in the city side decrease. But the problem is, that is failed to applied in the real life. According to the investigation conducted in the California, United States, the number of house in the city side was around 3times more than country side at 1990 and prices was around 2times higher in average. However in 2010, the price of house in cityside is 3times higher than country side but the number of house in the city side was even 5times higher than country side.
<br/>
<br/>
As there are numerous workplaces in the city, housing prices and rental fees there are higher compared to the countryside. This is due to the law of supply and demand. One might expect that building more houses in the city would decrease housing prices. However, in reality, this principle doesn't always apply. According to an investigation conducted in California, United States, in 1990, the number of houses in the city was roughly three times greater than in the countryside, and the average prices were about twice as high. However, by 2010, housing prices in the city were three times higher than in the countryside, despite the number of houses in the city being five times higher than in the countryside
<br/>
<br/>

lots of -> numerous
than -> compared to
we can expect -> one might expect
rent fee -> rental fee
around -> roughly
more -> greater
around -> about
two times -> twice as
<br/>
<br/>
The unexpected Matthew effect as you can see in the above investigation is derived from Regional development, the variable of which we had to account for and ruled out but overlooked. Since population density ,which undoubtedly correlated to development of local society, in the city side increases over time unlike from rural side, the city side increasingly developed over time. This curcimstance correspondingly resulted in another increasing demand.

The unexpected Matthew effect, as you can see in the above investigation, is derived from regional development, a variable that we had to account for and rule out but overlooked. Due to the increase in population density over time, which is undoubtedly correlated with the development of the local society, the city side experiences continuous growth. Consequently, this circumstance leads to an increasing demand
<br/>
<br/>
came -> stems, derived
over time -> continuous ~
<br/>
<br/>
but which phenomenon ,which is about only few local society is developing, is dangerous even though that probably yeilds siginificent profit on the society. for example, when war is occering, whole country is subseptive to few misile attack to some city. Additionally we also valnurable to the situation whether some people, who manage the region the most power is concentrated in, change their mind to be extremely selfish.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there is a phenomenon that is specific to only a few developing local societies, yet it is dangerous despite its potential to yield significant profits for society. For example, during times of war, the entire country becomes susceptible to missile attacks targeted at specific cities. Additionally, we are also vulnerable to situations where the people who hold the most power in a region change their mindset to become extremely selfish
<br/>
<br/>
is dangerous -> poses danger
subjective -> susceptible
valnurable -> vulnerable
<br/>
<br/>
In conclution, building new house in the city side can relieve temporary problem and enabling us to yield substantial profit right away. However, in the long way, it will excerbate permement imparity between rural and urban which ultimately bring us loss.

In conclusion, building new houses in the city can temporarily alleviate problems and enable us to immediately generate substantial profits. However, in the long run, it can exacerbate the permanent disparity between rural and urban areas, ultimately resulting in losses

right away -> immediately
in the long way -> in the long run (길게보면)
excerbate -> exacerbate
imparity -> disparity
side -> area
