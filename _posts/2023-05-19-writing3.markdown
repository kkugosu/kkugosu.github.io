Throughout history, art has always been intertwined with the human species. It may have been used for prayers to deities or as a means of communication between individuals. Despite the lack of clarity regarding its origins and beginnings, it continues to play a significant role in today's society. There is controversy surrounding the meaning of art, and in the following paragraph, I will explain my perspective on this controversy.
