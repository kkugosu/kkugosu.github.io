Throughout history, art has always been intertwined with the human species. It may have been used for prayers to deities or as a means of communication between individuals. Despite the lack of clarity regarding its origins and beginnings, it continues to play a significant role in today's society. There is controversy surrounding the meaning of art, and in the following paragraph, I will explain my perspective on this controversy.

i firstly wanna say art education is not meaningless. every human behavior has their own meaning at the aspect of pursuing the happier life. we earn to eat more edible food and live in more livable house and more which things giving us preasure. if we can get presure without earning, it is also another plausable way to live. eventhough there is less people to demand your art so you can't earn plenty of money, you still satisfy of your job also even resulting in less consumption of money for another things to gain happiness. as educating art result in peoples to be more skillful, their work becoming more demandable eventually resulting in they to live more happily.

I firstly want to say that art education is not meaningless. Every human behavior has its own meaning in terms of pursuing a happier life. We earn to have more edible food, live in a more livable house, and acquire things that bring us pleasure. However, if we can find fulfillment without solely focusing on earning, it is also a plausible way to live. Even if there are fewer people demanding your art and you can't earn a substantial amount of money, you can still find satisfaction in your job. This can even lead to reduced consumption of money on other things, as you prioritize the pursuit of happiness. As art education equips people with skills, their work becomes more in demand, eventually resulting in a happier life for them.

but it doesn't means art education should be essentional. we can't repel someone to learn another things that does not helpful for his life. if we learn everything like this way, we can't be professional at any subject. someone want to learn art but someone doesn't. as i said before, we should respect every single person's inclination.

However, this does not imply that art education should be deemed essential for everyone. We cannot impose upon individuals to learn something that may not be directly beneficial to their lives. If we attempt to learn everything in this manner, we would be unable to specialize and become experts in any particular field. It is important to recognize that while some individuals may have a passion for art and choose to pursue it, others may not share the same inclination. As mentioned earlier, it is crucial to respect and honor each person's unique interests and inclinations.

in conclution, as we live in
