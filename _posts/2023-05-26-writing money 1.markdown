Q
<br/>
in some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. some people think that this is good for a country, while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn
<br/>
discuss both views and give your opinion
<br/>
A
<br/>
for centuries, difference in money between poverty and wealth has been exsist. there is some contraversy about that problem. i agree with advocating government to restrict the amount people can earn and i will elaborate further on my perspective in the following paragraph.

For centuries, the disparity in wealth between poverty and affluence has persisted. This issue has sparked controversy and differing opinions. Personally, I support the idea of government intervention to regulate the amount individuals can earn, and I will delve into my viewpoint in more detail in the following paragraph.
<br/>
> wealthy -> affluence
<br/>
> has been exsist -> persisted
<br/>
> restrict -> intervention to regulate
<br/>
> elaborate on -> delve into
<br/>

if some earn most of money, other become tortured form poverty as long as wealthy don't distribute their portion of money. most people usually think we earn depending on how much we did but normal people don't have enought opportunity to learn enough. they become poverty because simply don't know any better. every people doing their best on their own way but metthew effect is getting worser. if someone don't learn enough, they don't even know why they can't learn and they fight each other rather than advocate government to educate them more. so this situation is getting even harder to manage.

If some individuals earn the majority of the money, others are subjected to the torment of poverty, as long as the wealthy fail to distribute their share of wealth. Many people commonly believe that earnings are directly tied to the amount of effort exerted, but ordinary individuals often lack sufficient opportunities to acquire adequate knowledge. They find themselves in poverty simply because they lack awareness of better options. Each person strives to the best of their ability, but the Matthew Effect, wherein the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, worsens. When individuals do not receive adequate education, they remain unaware of the reasons behind their learning difficulties and end up fighting amongst themselves instead of advocating for increased government support in education. Consequently, this situation becomes increasingly challenging to manage.
<br/>
> most -> majority
<br/>
> tortured by -> subjected to the torment
<br/>
> don't -> fail
<br/>
> portion of -> share of
<br/>
> depending on -> tied to
<br/>
> how much we did -> effort exerted
<br/>
> don't know -> remain unaware of
<br/>
> fight each other -> fighting amongst themselves
<br/>
> harder -> increasingly challenging
<br/>

and also, if we just neglect the disparity between wealthy and poverty, this will eventually resulting in diminishing diversity of human species. if we lose variasity, we become subjective to desaster which aim to specific genetics like gene desease and also if wealthy doesn't goes together with great personality, our lives becomming more and more bad.

And also, if we neglect the disparity between wealth and poverty, it will eventually result in the diminishing diversity of the human species. When we lose diversity, we become susceptible to disasters that target specific genetics, such as genetic diseases. Additionally, if wealth is not accompanied by a great personality, our lives become increasingly challenging and negative.
<br/>
subjective to -> susceptible to, subject to
<br/>
aim -> target
<br/>
goes together -> accompanied by
<br/>
bad -> challenging and negative
