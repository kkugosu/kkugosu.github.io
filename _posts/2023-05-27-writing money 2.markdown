The investigation conducted by the media in Boston, USA, on the changing number of local businesses and average income over the past 50 years reveals a simultaneous decline in both indicators, indicating a positive correlation between them. The underlying reason behind this phenomenon lies in the flow of money. The primary beneficiary of this trend is the head office, as the money ultimately gravitates towards the central office of companies rather than staying within the local community.

For example, let's assume you are managing to sell a used car and your neighbor is selling fruit. If they buy the car from you and you buy fruit from them, both of you earn money. However, if you buy fruit from a big market and they buy a car from a big company, both of you will eventually incur a loss. This principle can be applied to other goods and regions in a similar manner.

in conclusion, company offer the goods in cheaper price than local business which is superficially seems to cost effective and good for everyone. however as long as they don't distribute their share of money, this will eventually incur the diminish and stagnation of local business and community. sadly individuals can not convince others to refrain from buying big company's stuff because that usually fail to make everyone to do that simultaneously which result in inconsistence. but government can manage that problem by enacting the law which is why government stands for.

In conclusion, when companies offer goods at a cheaper price compared to local businesses, it may seem cost-effective and beneficial for everyone on the surface. However, if these companies fail to distribute their fair share of money, it will eventually lead to the decline and stagnation of local businesses and communities. Unfortunately, individuals alone cannot persuade others to refrain from buying products from big companies, as such efforts often lack simultaneous action and result in inconsistency. Nevertheless, the government can address this problem by enacting laws, as that is its role and responsibility.
