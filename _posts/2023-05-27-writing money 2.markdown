The investigation conducted by the media in Boston, USA, on the changing number of local businesses and average income over the past 50 years reveals a simultaneous decline in both indicators, indicating a positive correlation between them. The underlying reason behind this phenomenon lies in the flow of money. The primary beneficiary of this trend is the head office, as the money ultimately gravitates towards the central office of companies rather than staying within the local community.

For example, let's assume you are managing to sell a used car and your neighbor is selling fruit. If they buy the car from you and you buy fruit from them, both of you earn money. However, if you buy fruit from a big market and they buy a car from a big company, both of you will eventually incur a loss. This principle can be applied to other goods and regions in a similar manner.
