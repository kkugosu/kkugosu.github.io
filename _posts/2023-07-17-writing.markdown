Active individuals tend to follow their curiosity, leading to improved intelligence compared to others, as well as greater independence because they challenge traditional practices by asking questions. When active individuals are placed in departments that require continuous change and experimentation, they thrive in such environments. However, if they are placed in departments that do not offer such opportunities, they may experience significant stress. Wearing a costume can create a sense of unity and conformity, but it can also constrain divergent thinking, limiting the possibility of questioning and stifling creativity
