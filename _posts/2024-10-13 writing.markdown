which is between decrement of intimate and beneficial way. 


The advancement of various electronic products has facilitated new modes of interaction within modern society. However, there has been considerable debate 
regarding the impact of technology on communication, particularly centered around whether it diminishes intimacy or enhances its utility.


i will elaborate my opinion of these argument on the following paragraph further.
I will further elaborate on my opinion regarding these arguments in the following paragraphs.

from the standpoint of the first group, technology induced diminishing face-to-face connection. decades ago, communication techniques were usually form of handwriting letter with hard paper. but nowadays,
with the advent of internet, mobile phone and email communication is dominating. for instance, we usually talk with frineds by sending text or call and we talk with professor by email but these things 
must be done with physical connection long time ago. therefore first group argue these phonomenon might result in unresponsible behavior and lake of consideration.

From the perspective of the first group, technology has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions. Decades ago, communication techniques typically involved handwritten letters on paper. 
However, with the advent of the internet, mobile phones, and email, digital communication now dominates. 
For example, we often communicate with friends through text messages or calls, and correspond with professors via email?tasks that once required physical presence. 
As a result, the first group argues that these changes may encourage irresponsible behavior and a lack of consideration for others.

However, from the perspective of the opposing viewpoint, technology enable us to interact from various region. for the past era, it was almost impossible to talk with people who live far from our residence.
However internet and settlite connect us almost everywhere in the earth. we can talk regardless of distance between us nowadays. If our family travel to the europe and i stay in the asia, i still can keep in touch
with my family and we even talk with friends who live in another country and learn their culture. so development of communication technology result our life more prosperous.

However, from the perspective of the opposing viewpoint, technology enables us to communicate across various regions. In past eras, it was nearly impossible to converse with individuals living far from our place of residence. 
Yet, with the advent of the internet and satellite technology, we are now connected almost everywhere on the planet. Today, we can communicate effortlessly, regardless of the distance between us. 
For instance, even if our family travels to Europe while we remain in Asia, we can still maintain regular contact. Moreover, we are able to converse with friends in different countries and gain insights into their cultures. 
Thus, the advancement of communication technology has greatly contributed to a more prosperous and enriched life.

In conclusion, in my opinion, i partially agree with that advencement of technology can have negative effect on our community and online communicatioin inhere some level of crisis like incurrance of conflict and damage the citizenship.
but that problem is not on that technology but that is the thing that nation have to deal with. we can lose positive relationship by online network and lose sincerety but we can gain more positive things through that

In conclusion, I am inclined to partially agree that the advancement of technology may exert negative influences on our community, and that online communication inherently harbors certain risks, 
such as the potential for conflict and the erosion of civic values. However, the root of this issue does not lie with technology itself, but rather with the manner in which it is addressed by governing bodies and society as a whole. 
While there is the risk of diminishing genuine relationships and sincerity through online interactions, it is also true that substantial positive benefits can be derived from these advancements.
