Some people believe that the government should impose taxes on unhealthy foods, such as fast food, to improve public health. 
Discuss whether you agree with this idea or if you think it should be left to individual choice.

there has been debate between two groups, first one argue that government should penelize the unhealthy food and another argue that we should leave it to the free market without interrupting.
i am agree with the first opinion and i will further elaborate on my thinking in the following paragraph

There has been a debate between two groups: one argues that the government should penalize unhealthy foods, while the other contends that we should allow the free market to operate without interference. 
I agree with the first perspective, and I will further elaborate on my reasoning in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, let us consider the perspective that advocates for leaving it to the free market. Our society has progressed along with the balance between demand and production. 
If we find high demand for certain product, they call high price for that product so we try more hard to make production and vice versa. our society is advanced through this process
and we automatically find what we need so far. so in the case of fast food, if people think this food is not good, they will not try to buy this food and this will demage the company income.
and interruption of government can demange to the society

To begin with, let us examine the perspective that supports leaving the regulation of the market to free economic forces. Our society has advanced in alignment with the equilibrium between demand and production. 
When there is a high demand for a particular product, the price naturally rises, prompting increased production efforts, and vice versa. 
This process has driven societal progress, allowing us to meet our needs through self-regulating mechanisms.
In the case of fast food, for example, if consumers perceive it as unhealthy, they will gradually reduce their consumption, which will, in turn, affect the revenue of the companies producing it. 
Government intervention, in this context, could disrupt this natural market correction, potentially causing unintended harm to society.

From the opposing perspective, natural correction does not always work. for the drug problem which is spreading word wide these days, 
people does not always try to keep distance from that eventhough they already know the effect of that. the problem which will accelate that phonomenon is that our society in these days even have high difference between poverty and rich, 
causing the information difference. for example, some of the big company can play the lobby to hide their corruption and make people unable to discern their bad product. which is also apply in the fast food.
from the research conducted at the oxford university biochemistry labatory in 2021, the statistice tell us the american government does not constrict the cancer factor ingredient in their fast food,
so even though in the same fast food, the portion of cancer factor ingredient is 30times higher than england ones.

From an opposing perspective, natural market correction does not always function as intended. For example, in the case of the global drug problem, individuals often fail to distance themselves from harmful substances despite being fully aware of their detrimental effects. 
One factor exacerbating this issue is the growing disparity between the rich and the poor in today��s society, which leads to an uneven distribution of information.
For instance, large corporations may engage in lobbying efforts to conceal their wrongdoings, making it difficult for the public to discern harmful products. This same dynamic can be observed in the fast food industry. 
According to research conducted at Oxford University��s biochemistry laboratory in 2021, statistics revealed that the U.S. government does not strictly regulate certain carcinogenic ingredients in fast food. As a result, 
the concentration of these harmful substances in American fast food is reportedly up to 30 times higher than in similar products in the UK.

i personally agree with that government should intervent between citizen and large cooperation for free market. not only in the case of fast food, also there is many kinds of harm food in the world.
for example, some vicious company in china make fake milk and fake cheeze which can not be known to people nomally and lots of people actually dead from that. eventhough government intervention can
slow down the market, it is still better than simply let them corrupted.

I personally agree that the government should intervene between citizens and large corporations in the free market. 
This is applicable not only in the case of fast food but also in the case of many types of harmful foods worldwide. 
For instance, some unscrupulous companies in China produce counterfeit milk and cheese, which typically cannot be detected by consumers. 
Many people have actually died from consuming these products. Although government intervention may slow down the market, it is preferable to allowing corruption to prevail unchecked.
