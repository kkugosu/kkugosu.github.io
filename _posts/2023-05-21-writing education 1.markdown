As time progresses, the world is becoming more globalized, making it easier for us to visit and communicate with other countries. Unlike in the past, we now have the opportunity to compare our own culture with that of different countries, allowing us to revise and improve our own cultural practices. Through international exchange visits, we can gain a deeper understanding of other cultures and learn valuable lessons from them. I will elaborate on my perspective on international exchange visits in the following paragraph.

if you to live in another country, it can be cost you need to find house to stay, you need to find airplain ticket and also if you are going to wealthy country, food will be also more expensive than your own country. you have to learn about another countries transport system and you have to buy and connect your data. and it can be also difficult to make friends because you or your friends are not accustomed to rase diversity. if at least one of them or you are not good at english, it also must play the crutial point to making you hard to make friennds

<br/>
If you choose to live in another country, there will be associated costs such as finding a place to stay, purchasing airplane tickets, and potentially dealing with higher food prices in wealthier countries. You will also need to familiarize yourself with the transportation system and arrange for internet connectivity. Additionally, making friends might be challenging due to differences in cultural background and racial diversity. Language proficiency, particularly in English, can also be a crucial factor in establishing social connections even if either you or your friends are not fluent in it.

even though every disadvantage arise from living in another country, advantages are still seems to cover every disadvantages. maybe it can be hard to study in that situation due to busy of making yourself familierize to that environment. but most of all, you can learn plenty of another cultures through that processes.

Despite the disadvantages that may arise from living in another country, the advantages seem to outweigh them. It can be challenging to study in such a situation due to the busyness of familiarizing yourself with the new environment. However, this process presents an opportunity to learn about other cultures instead.
<br/>

busy of -> busyness of

근데 오히려 -> however ~ instead
