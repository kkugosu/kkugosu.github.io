Today, young people are often exposed to aggressive news that fails to encourage deep thinking but rather stimulates their superficial senses. Some argue that the excessive emphasis on superficial aspects like appearance and wealth, rather than inner qualities such as personality, has a detrimental effect on young people. I will elaborate further on my opinion in the following paragraph.
<br/>
> peripheral nerves -> superficial senses
<br/>
> superpecial things -> superficial aspects

every human's behavior is affected by rewards. that principle bring advertisement company and news to expose people success from superficial aspect rather than from deeply elaborating as most people wants to get the news which is superficial things. we don't admit the success from ability and elaborate which phenomenon arise from difference of start point among us but that should not make us to prevent from elaborating.

Every human's behavior is influenced by rewards. This principle leads advertising companies and news outlets to highlight superficial aspects of people's success rather than providing in-depth elaboration. This is because most people are interested in news that focuses on superficial matters. We often fail to acknowledge success based on one's abilities and the effort put into it. However, we should not overlook success based on ability and depth, even though there may be differences in starting points among individuals. This should not discourage us from seeking and appreciating deeper understanding and elaboration.

our life is about reward. every people's behavior is based on what they get from their behavior. reward is diverse in form such as money, love, or even knowledge. as long as advertisement company highlight success in superficial things, this will affect young people to think they can get high reward from superficial matters.

<br/>
Our lives revolve around rewards. Every person's behavior is driven by what they gain from their actions. Rewards appear in diverse forms, such as money, love, or even knowledge. When advertisement companies primarily emphasize success in superficial matters, it influences young people to believe that they can attain significant rewards from superficial aspects.
