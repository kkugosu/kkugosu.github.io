Some people believe that traditional games and childhood games are vital for the development of children and should be preserved, 
while others argue that modern games and digital media provide more benefits for learning and development. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

there has been argument between two groups. first group support traditional game is paramount for childrens development so they need to encourage children to play traditional game. 
second group contend game based on digital presence inheretly harbor more beneficial to cognitive ability. i will further elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.

There has been a debate between two groups regarding the most beneficial type of games for children's development. 
The first group advocates that traditional games are paramount for children's development and thus, they should encourage children to engage in traditional games. 
The second group contends that games based on digital platforms inherently offer more benefits to cognitive abilities. I will further elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.

from the perspective of the first group, conventional game serve the crutial rule for improvement of children mentality. we have many different kinds of game and sometimes they have to cooperate
to win the game and soemtimes they need to compete to win the game. in real word situation, they are easily get hurt so they got to learn how to concede and understand each other. 
they learn considerate behavior which is hardly achieved in the online game.

From the perspective of the first group, conventional games play a crucial role in the development of children's mentality. 
There are many different kinds of games, where sometimes cooperation is necessary to achieve victory, while at other times competition is required. 
In real-world situations, children can easily get hurt; thus, they must learn how to concede and understand each other. Through these games, they acquire considerate behavior, 
which is seldom achieved in online gaming.

From the opposite viewpoint, online game can improve intelligence far more than classic game. we become to be able to embody our idea much more easier than before by utilizeing the programming.
we can play much more diverse game than before. moreover, since we can yield the income from the online game, for example selling the item or selling the download authority and even through 
commission of exchange items, there is active niche market about game and they researched a lot of how to make people happy. their agony got conclusion to know when they make game difficult
to solve, by making people to think a lot, people tends to think more and therefore more addictive and they feel happy through this process. so consequently online game can make people more intelligent
and help children's inductive ability.

From the opposing perspective, online games are believed to enhance intelligence far more significantly than classic games. 
By utilizing programming, individuals can more easily actualize their ideas than ever before. The diversity of games available online exceeds that of traditional options. 
Additionally, online gaming offers the potential for revenue generation, for example, through the sale of items, download rights, and commissions from item exchanges. 
This has fostered an active niche market where extensive research is conducted on how to increase user satisfaction. It has been concluded that creating challenging games, 
which require extensive thinking, not only makes the games more addictive but also enhances happiness through cognitive engagement. 
Consequently, online games can substantially boost intelligence and foster children¡¯s inductive reasoning skills.

In conclusion, i am on the side of opposing perspective. eventhough classic game can serve important role for the human relationship and mental mature, it can be also achieved through teaching and if they are not accompaied with sufficient management,
that inherit the crisis of violence because that is susceptible to physical presence and harassment caused by some strong childlen. in that case, online game can be safer than offline game. and also
mental matuality can be learnd from another way. but it is obvious that online game is more beneficial to intelligence inductive ability and it is easier way to improve because they find enjoyment while think harder.

In conclusion, I align with the opposing perspective. Although classic games play an important role in fostering human relationships and mental maturity, these benefits can also be achieved through education. 
Without sufficient management, classic games may inherit the risk of violence, as they are susceptible to physical presence and harassment by more dominant children. In such cases, online games can be safer than offline games. 
Furthermore, mental maturity can be learned through other means. However, it is clear that online games are more beneficial for developing intelligence and inductive reasoning abilities, as they offer an enjoyable way to engage in more complex thinking.
