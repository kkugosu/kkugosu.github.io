Q
<br/>
Some people think that space exploration is a waste of resources while others think that it is essential for mankind to continue to explore the universe in which we live
<br/>
A
<br/>
With the advancement of techonology over time, we are getting to explore more dangerous region. some argue exploring universe pose hazard so we have to restrain the area to explore. in the following paragraph, i will elaborate on my perspective regarding this argument.
<br/>
With the advancement of technology over time, we have been able to explore increasingly dangerous regions. Some argue that exploring the universe poses hazards, and thus we should limit the areas we explore. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding this argument.
<br/>
We have to overcome numerous danger whenever we challenge new area. For example, when we try to dive water, we have to overcome danger of shark, water pressure, toxic creature, even swift flow of water. however, now we can travel with submarine and many kinds of robots. We also available to overcome the obstacle of unknown hazard in the universe through our techonology.
<br/>
We encounter numerous dangers whenever we venture into new areas. For instance, when diving into water, we must overcome the risks of encountering sharks, dealing with water pressure, encountering toxic creatures, and navigating swift water currents. However, thanks to advancements in technology, we now have submarines and various types of robots that aid in exploration. Furthermore, our technological capabilities enable us to overcome the obstacles posed by unknown hazards in the universe
<br/>
explore -> venture
water flow -> water currents
because of -> thanks to
many kinds of -> various types of
that helps exploration -> that aid in exploration
techonological level -> technological capabilities
<br/>
the importance of exploring is based on learning which itself is worthwhile as long as we pursuing happiness through this anyway so it is not a waste of resourse. According to AI research conducted at MIT university, the performance of agent increased when they make agent to explore following their own curiosity ,which eventually result in agent to maximize IG(information gain). As we can see through research, explore is correlated with intelligence. In above example, we get to learn about sea more deeper and we got to know new creature and their skills to adapt their environment, when we explore universe, we can obtain substantial knowledge which ultimately advantageous to human life.

The importance of exploration lies in the process of learning, which in itself is valuable, especially when pursued for the sake of happiness. Therefore, it is not a waste of resources. According to AI research conducted at MIT University, agent performance increases when agents are allowed to explore based on their own curiosity, ultimately resulting in maximizing information gain (IG). As observed through research, exploration is strongly correlated with intelligence. In the aforementioned example, deep-sea exploration enables us to acquire a deeper understanding of the ocean, discover new creatures, and learn about their adaptations to their environment. Similarly, exploring the universe provides us with substantial knowledge that ultimately benefits human life.
<br/>
어디에서 나오다 -> lies
그거자체는 -> which in itself
for -> for the sake of
above -> aforementioned
learn -> acquire understanding
<br/>
In conclusion, explore itself is safe when we explore in the range of our coverage of technological capabilities. Moreover, we also can acquire our understanding of nature so can learning. As we consider aforementioned factors, exploring universe is highly recommanded and not waste of resorce

In conclusion, exploration itself is safe when conducted within the range of our technological capabilities. Furthermore, it allows us to enhance our understanding of nature and facilitates learning. Considering these factors, exploring the universe is highly recommended and not a waste of resources.

resorce -> resources
