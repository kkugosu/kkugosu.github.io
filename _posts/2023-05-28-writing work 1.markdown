<br/>
As society becomes more diverse, individuals are increasingly taking on specific roles instead of trying to do everything themselves. With this diversification of roles, effective communication becomes crucial for accomplishing big projects. Some individuals prefer to communicate more frequently, and I will further elaborate on my perspective in the following paragraph.
<br/>
> getting -> increasingly
<br/>
> some -> some individuals
<br/>
> serve role -> taking on role
<br/>
> their own -> specific
<br/>

it is important to see things from another person's point of view as it will prevent works to be concentrated on few persons resulting in improving the performance doing a project as a whole. moreover we can prevent ourselves from doing unnessarily elaborate by anticipate the workflow. for example, when we build website, if developer already know manager don't usually use customer service, they don't need to make that window.

<br/>
Considering things from another person's perspective is crucial as it prevents work from being biased towards a few individuals, leading to improved performance by ensuring the collaboration of all team members on a project. Additionally, anticipating the workflow allows us to avoid unnecessary elaboration. For example, when building a website, if a developer knows that the manager rarely utilizes customer service, they can omit creating that specific page.
<br/>
> concentrated -> biased, skewed
<br/>
> concentrate 는 좀더 추상적인
<br/>
> bias skew는 물리적인
<br/>
> expect -> anticipate
<br/>
> expect = 결과물에 대한 예상
<br/>
> anticipate 미래의 사건
<br/>
> use -> utilize
<br/>
> don't make -> omit
<br/>

but if there is inequality of information or manager is lake of consideration, and also if they don't compensate enough money to staff, act of sharing is becomming meaningless and that even can cause employee to give leeway to get nagging. for example, assumimg employee talk with employer on weekends and employer is lake of considerate, they probably ask employee to work more without money.

<br/>
But if there is a lack of information equality or the manager lacks consideration, and if they don't provide sufficient compensation to the staff, the act of sharing becomes meaningless. This can even lead the employer to justify nagging. For example, if an employee talks to their employer on weekends and the employer lacks consideration, they may ask the employee to work more without providing additional compensation.

<br/>
in conclution, as long as we fail to see things from other people's side, like modern society, it is better to work just for our given portion.

<br/>
In conclusion, if we continue to overlook other people's perspectives, similar to modern society, it is advisable to focus on fulfilling our own assigned roles.
