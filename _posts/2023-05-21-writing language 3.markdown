Q
<br/>
some people think that a person can never understand the culture of a country unless they speak the language.
<br/>
do you agree with this opinion?
<br/>
A
<br/>
we sometimes can see the argument that says languages have only few origins.however, with the time progression, human species have gained the diversity in language to meet each other's needs of expression which varies across the country. this development bring languages to be interwined with culture. someone argue we can't learn another culture unless learning language. i will elaborate my perspective of view with this argument in the following paragraph further.

We sometimes encounter the argument that languages have only a few origins. However, as time has progressed, the human species has gained linguistic diversity to fulfill the varied needs of expression across different countries. This development has resulted in languages becoming intertwined with culture. Some argue that we cannot truly understand another culture without learning its language. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding this argument

it can be difficult to learn another countries culture without learning their language because we can see their priority from way to talk. when their country is surrounded by sea, they are used to use the term about ship, fish. when their country is located in the north part of earth, they are used to use language about snow, blizzard. their language is probably developed to that way so as to express details about their important things.

<br/>
It can be difficult to understand another country's culture without learning their language, as their language reveals their priorities and preferences. For instance, if a country is surrounded by sea, their language may incorporate terms specific to ships and fish. Similarly, if a country is located in the northern part of the Earth, their language may include words specific to snow and blizzards. These linguistic nuances are likely developed to express the important aspects of their environment and daily life

<br/>

<br/>
> incorporate = mix together
<br/>
> north part of the earth -> northern part of the earth

but we can also learn their culture from their food, clothes, building eventhough they can not express everything about it.

<br/>
But we can also learn about their culture through their food, clothing, and architecture, even though they may not be able to fully express everything about it through language.
<br/>
learn from -> learn through
<br/>

express everything -> fully express everything
<br/>

eventhough -> even though
