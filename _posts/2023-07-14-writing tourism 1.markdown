With globalization affecting the entire world, including the modernization of transportation systems, it has become increasingly easy to travel across countries. Traveling to other countries is undoubtedly a great experience for travelers, but it is important to consider the effects on local societies and citizens within the travel industry. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my perspective regarding the pros and cons of this phenomenon
<br/>
<br/>
becomes -> has become
travel -> travel to
obviously -> undoubtedly
local society -> local societies
effect on ~ of -> effect on ~ within

<br/>
<br/>
To discuss with the aspect of local society, because tourists use lots of money in the excuse of experience even to the normal stuff which is not worth that money, common people can easily get in the black. government can set small market to make tourist experience another culture easily and common people can pay them for trade their stuff at the crowded environment. morever, if goverment architect some museum or art gallary, they can earn money permemently by simply selling ticket with minimal conservative process .they can earn great amount of profit like that way so they take the risk of posibility of another crime and destruction of environment on the certain extent.
<br/>
<br/>

To discuss the impact on local society, it is important to note that tourists often spend a significant amount of money, even on ordinary items that may not warrant such expenses. This can lead to a negative influence on the local community, as common people can easily become involved in illicit activities. To address this, the government can establish small markets that allow tourists to experience different cultures while providing opportunities for locals to engage in trade within a bustling environment. Furthermore, if the government constructs museums or art galleries, they can generate consistent revenue by selling tickets with minimal administrative processes. Although this approach can yield substantial profits, it also carries risks such as potential crime and environmental damage, albeit to a certain extent.
<br/>
<br/>
discussing with -> to discuss
normal stuff -> ordinary item
worth that money -> warrant such expenses
get in the black
trade in -> trade within
leave the profit -> generate revenue, yield profit
maintenance cost
dispite of -> albeit to
<br/>

On the other hand, tourist can serve the role of sharing the culture so individuals have more opportunity to learn other culture, especially their habitat, so they can evaluate their own culture from one step back and they can revolute by burden old and bad habitat and accept new habitat. additionally they also have apportunity to learn another language and start relationship with another countries people. even though they are always inherit the risk since we didn't fully understand how they are, but we always need some challenge to change.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, tourists can play a crucial role in sharing cultures, providing individuals with more opportunities to learn about other cultures, particularly the local customs and ways of life. This exposure allows them to evaluate their own culture from a different perspective and potentially bring about positive changes by shedding old and negative practices while embracing new ones. Additionally, tourists have the chance to learn new languages and establish relationships with people from other countries. Although there is always an inherent risk in encountering the unfamiliar, it is through such challenges that we can foster growth and transformation.
<br/>
<br/>
role of -> role in
habitat -> customs
burden -> shedding
custom -> practice
start relationship -> establish relationship
foster growth
change -> transformation
<br/>
<br/>
in summary, i discussed about advantage and disadvantage of tourist industry so far. tourism is highly profitable for local industry by share our cultrue through market, museum, gallary and more. Moreover that is also beneficial to individual at the aspect of habitat, education, relationship and so on. therefore i believe improve tourism must be rewarding for everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
In summary, I have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the tourism industry thus far. Tourism proves to be highly profitable for local industries as it allows for the sharing of our culture through markets, museums, galleries, and more. Furthermore, it benefits individuals in terms of their understanding of different habitats, educational opportunities, and the establishment of relationships, among other aspects. Therefore, I firmly believe that the improvement and development of tourism can be rewarding for everyone involved.
